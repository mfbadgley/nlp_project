At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\\nBrady Connor\\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with Lowe McAdam , our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hans Vestberg, our incoming Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.\\nBefore I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials which we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.\\nBefore I turn the call over to Low for his remarks, let me start with a walk through of the second quarter consolidated earnings on Slide 3. For the second quarter of 2018 we reported earnings of $1 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings this quarter included charge for product realignment of $658 million, mainly related to the discontinuation of the go90 platform and associated content. Severance charges of $339 million, and acquisition integration related charges of $120 million primarily consisting of costs pertaining to Oath. The net impact of these items after-tax was approximately $0.9 billion or $0.20 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items and the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard adjusted earnings per share was $0.99 in the second quarter compared to $0.96 a year ago. On a comparable basis adjusted earnings per share before the impacts of tax reform and revenue recognition were up 3.1% year-over-year.\\nLet's now turn to Slide 4. Consistent with the approach we established last quarter we have provided a table that illustrates the ongoing effects from the adoption of the revenue recognition standard on our financial results. As a reminder, the adoption of the revenue recognition standard results in a reduction of the wireless service revenue offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue, as well as the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments. The impact from this change has been fairly consistent throughout the first two quarters of 2018. On a year-to-date basis, the cumulative impact of revenue recognition was $0.14 per share. For the full year we expect the impact of earnings per share to be between $0.27 and $0.31. The accretive benefit to operating income in 2018 is expected to moderate in 2019 and then become insignificant in 2020 as the timing impacts to revenue and commission costs converge. But the remainder of this call, financial results will exclude the impact of this accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Lowe.\\nLowell McAdam\\nThank you, Brady and good morning everyone. This is the last time I'll have to discuss Verizon results with you so I'd like to take a minute and offer some perspective after serving as Verizon CEO for the past seven years.\\nWhen I first took over from Ivan in 2011, the company was well positioned for the future. We were leading the charge in the wireless industry by pushing the ecosystem and driving new user experiences with our robust launch of 4G LTE service. We were growing our fiber to the home business, Fios, and expanding penetration in highly competitive markets. The company had a strong balance sheet and financial profile so that we had the flexibility to execute whatever strategy we chose.\\nIf I look at where we are today, once again the company is well positioned for the future. Our financial and operating results for the first half of 2018 are strong as evidenced by our service revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. Verizon has 100% ownership of our wireless business and it's industry-leading network and customer base. We have driven the 5G ecosystem by pushing the industry to adopt the next-generation several years ahead of original expectations. And we are positioned to be the clear leader in the deployment of 5G services based on our technological expertise, asset base, engineering talent and spectrum portfolio. This leadership position is attracting opportunities in areas such as over-the-top TV, smart cities, transportation, education and healthcare; just to name a few.\\nI believe the impact of 5G on consumers will be much bigger than any previous generation but the biggest impact will be on businesses as we provide the platform for the fourth industrial revolution. We know the consumer requires a mobile first digital information experience, and the new businesses that we have added such as Oath and our IoT platforms are poised to be at the forefront of enhancing our ability to meet this growing customer demand. Our Fios business and our recent one fiber expansion have proven that fiber-based network solutions will continue to be in high demand and can take significant share in mature markets. The cornerstone of our strategy will always be network leadership and customer experience.\\nVerizon has an outstanding leadership team, a unique portfolio of assets, solid financial profile and a strong balance sheet that enables us to deliver on the promise of the digital world. I'm also pleased to mention our recently announced tentative agreement with our unions to extend our labor contracts through August 2023; this will give all of our employees the ability to focus on our customers and execute our strategies without disruption. One of my least fond memories as CEO was a strike five days after taking over; I'm glad Hans won't share that experience.\\nWhat Brady didn't tell you when he started the call this morning is that the four of us are in Houston, Texas; it's an honor for us to be in Houston today to talk about our second quarter results, spend valuable time with our employees in the area and celebrate the quality of our customers in this great city. We have an excellent relationship with the city, with Mayor Turner, and with the greater Houston area, and we are very proud of our overall customer experience, network performance and community involvement, especially during some of the hardest times like Hurricane Harvey.\\nVerizon and the nation's best wireless network worked tirelessly to provide customers, loved ones, and first responders with an unparalleled level of reliability and quality when it matters the most. It is with great pleasure that we announce here today Houston as the third of our four initial commercial launch markets for our 5G residential broadband service that will be rolled out later this year. This is an exciting time for our company and the industry; I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that Verizon is making and our recent appointment of Hans Vestberg as CEO solidifies the leadership of this great company for years to come.\\n\\nAs I've said before, I'm confident that Hans is the right person to bring Verizon and into it's next chapter and he is the energizing force we need to position Verizon to lead the upcoming fourth industrial revolution. Matt will now take you through the details of our second quarter financial results which highlight the strength of Verizon. Hans will then outline our strategic priorities and talk about the opportunities that lie ahead.\\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks Lowe, and thank you for the many years of leadership and the support and encouragement you have provided to all of us.\\nI'd like to start by reviewing the consolidated results on Slide 6. Consolidated revenue was $32.2 billion on a reported basis including the impacts of revenue recognition. Excluding the impact of Oath and divested businesses, consolidated revenue is $30.2 billion, an increase of approximately 2.6%. The wireless business continues to be the primary driver of growth generating solid service revenue results. On a GAAP reported basis, we are expecting low to mid-single digit percentage consolidated revenue growth for the full year. The update of full year revenue guidance is due to better than expected equipment revenue trends.\\nExcluding special items, second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.6%, down from the prior year's margin of 36.5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.2 billion due to service revenue performance and as we continue to drive operational efficiencies across the business. Strong revenue momentum and solid margin performance keep us on-track to achieve low single digit percentage growth and adjusted EPS in 2018 before the net impact of tax reform and revenue recognition. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2018 to be at the low end of our guided range of 24% to 26%.\\nLet's now focus on cash flow results and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Our business segments are generating substantial cash flows. During the second quarter of 2018 cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.8 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion from the prior year and $3.1 billion sequentially; this was driven by strong results from the business, benefits from tax reform, and the completion of the transition to on balance sheet financing of our device payment plan receivables. But the second quarter -- capital spending was $3.3 billion bringing the year-to-date spend to $7.8 billion. We currently expect capital expenditures for the full year to be closer to the lower end of our guided range of $17 billion to $17.8 billion driven by efficiencies from our business excellence initiatives and CapEx management process, as well as the Intelligent Edge Network design. 2018 capital expenditures include deploying 5G for both, residential broadband and mobility launches.\\nFree cash flow totaled $6.5 billion in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with $114.6 billion of total debt which was comprised of $106 billion from secured debt and $8.6 billion of secured debt. As we stated at the beginning of the year, we intend to use the majority of the benefits from tax reform in 2018 to strengthen the balance sheet. We began to realize these benefits during the second quarter and our total debt balance declined by $4.4 billion sequentially. Our capital allocation methodology remains consistent focused on having a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders.\\nNow let's move on to reviews of the operating segments starting with wireless on Slide 8. Total wireless operating revenue increased 4.7% to $22.3 billion in the second quarter. Service revenue continues to generate strong results producing a 2.5% increase excluding the impact of revenue recognition driven by customer step-ups to higher access plans and increases in the average connections per account. Sequentially, service revenue increased by 1.5%. On a reported basis including the impact from revenue recognition, service revenue increased by 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. Customer migration to unsubsidized pricing continues to approach a steady state, currently at 82% for the quarter as compared to 75% a year ago, and 81% in the first quarter.\\n\\nIn the second quarter equipment revenue increased 6.8% driven by higher priced handsets more than offsetting a reduction in activation volumes. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone base had an outstanding device payment plan at the end of the quarter consistent with the prior year. Our wireless EBITDA was $10.3 billion in the second quarter which represents an increase of 5.5%. As a percent of total revenue EBITDA margin was 46.2%, up from 45.8% a year ago and was relatively flat on a sequential basis.\\nLet's now turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless operating metrics. Wireless continues to deliver solid results driven by the quality of our network experience and strong customer retention. In the second quarter net phone additions were 199,000 including 398,000 smartphones, postpaid net adds totaled 531,000 including tablet net losses of 37,000 offset by 369,000 other connected devices led by wearable's. Our postpaid phone churn of 0.75% is a result of our compelling customer experience on the nation's best network. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of customer retention at 0.80% or better. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.97% was slightly up compared to 0.94% in the prior year.\\nIn the quarter, postpaid device activations were 4.6% lower than the prior year of which about 80% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.0% as compared to 5.6% a year ago. During the quarter, 5.8 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid activity in the quarter reflected a total net loss of 236,000 devices compared to 19,000 prepaid net adds in the prior year. 150,000 of the prepaid losses in the quarter were basic phones.\\nNow let's move to our wireline segment on Slide 10. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment decreased 3.4% from the quarter due to ongoing secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition, partially offset by growth from our high quality fiber-based products. Consumer markets revenue decreased 1.4% driven by legacy core declines partially offset by Fios growth. Fios consumer revenue increased by 1.7% primarily due to our broadband offerings. In Fios we added 43,000 internet customers and had video losses of 37,000 in the quarter. Internet ads were driven by strong demand as customers value their broadband connection more than ever before. Video results continue to face macro pressures from chord-cutting [ph].\\nEnterprise Solutions revenue decreased 4.2% from the quarter driven by declines in legacy services partially offset by growth in our fiber-based products. On a constant currency basis, revenue is down 5.1%. Partner Solutions revenue declined 2.8%, the increasing customer demand for fiber access is a growth opportunity for this business and is mitigating declines in copper-based products. Within business markets revenue decreased 7.4% mainly due to reductions in CPE sales and ongoing headwinds from legacy services. Fiber-based products continue to grow and are becoming a more significant component of recurring revenue. Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 19.6% excluding the impacts of revenue recognition. Price compression on legacy products, secular trends and increasing content cost continue to pressure wireline margin performance. Excluding the impact from revenue recognition we expect margins to be around 20% for the near-term.\\nLet's now move on to Slide 11 to discuss our Media and IoT businesses. During the second quarter the Oath team continue to build out and operationalize it's content strategy and make progress towards the integration of Ad products into one interlinked cross platform and cross device solution. As we highlighted on our last call, the video platform became integrated in the first quarter. During the second quarter, half of the demand side platform for Ad inventory was integrated and Oath is on-track to complete integrating the remaining components of the platform within the second half of the year. We expect to see momentum build after advertisers and content owners have the ability to come to us on a single platform. For the second quarter Oath revenue is $1.9 billion which was relatively flat on a sequential basis. In our telematics business, total Verizon Connect revenue was $241 million. Total IoT revenue including Verizon Connect was up approximately 13%.\\n\\nLet's now move to Slide 12 to summarize our second quarter results. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results and our business is well positioned for growth into the future. Consolidated revenue growth was led by wireless service revenue turning positive, inclusive of the headwinds from revenue recognition. Our unlimited offerings are evolving to provide a new level of flexibility enabling people to customize their experience on the nation's best network. Churn rates remain low signaling excellent customer satisfaction and retention of the nation's best wireless customer base.\\nLast year we announced our goal to drive $10 billion in cumulative cash savings throughout the business over a four year period. Our business excellence initiative which includes zero-based budgeting is off to a solid start in 2018, it has yielded approximately $500 million of cumulative cash savings on a year-to-date basis. Most of the incremental cash savings realized in the second quarter related to network activities and are reflected in the lower total capital spend. The program remains on-track to deliver against our goals over the four year period. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased year-over-year driven by the strength of our revenue performance and operational efficiencies realized across the business.\\nFinally, we are making significant strides in honoring our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet. We substantially reduced net debt within the quarter and the business is generating strong cash flows as we prepare for the upcoming launch of 5G.\\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans to discuss our strategic priorities.\\nHans Vestberg\\nThank you, Matt and good morning everyone. First, let me say that it's a great honor to be named successor to Lowell, and I'm humbled by the opportunity to lead this great company. I'm looking forward to being part of leading the digitalization era into the more technology advanced market in the world which will have significantly positive impact on consumers, industries and our society for decades to come.\\nDuring my tenure with your Verizon I've been actively involved in setting the strategy and priorities for the company alongside Lowell, the board, and the rest of the leadership team. We have a laid our focus on execution on the fundamentals, we're positioning the business of future growth, maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, and driving sustainable financial performance for long-term value creation. We remain committed to announcing our network leadership position, strengthening our customer relationship, and driving efficiencies throughout the business. Verizon has assets in place to develop and provide the most advanced next-generation network which we called Verizon's Intelligent Edge Network. We are positioned for growth in the current generation and we are leading the way to fully capture the significant opportunity that lies ahead in the transition to the fifth generation of wireless services.\\nWe continue to be the clear leader in 4G performance driving further innovation, growth opportunities and implementing new network capabilities that will further enhance our customer's experience. We have made the strategic invest in millimeter way [ph], spectrum that enable ultra-wideband 5G services. Our fiber [indiscernible] would build out on the way in over 50 markets outside of our higher ILEC footprint that will allow us to take full advantage of the many used cases that will come to bear in 5G. Our Intelligent Edge Network design allows us to realize significant efficiencies by utilizing common infrastructure [ph] in the core and providing flexibility at the edge of the network to meet customer requirements. Our Oath and IoT assets will provide a platform for us to participate in the use cases that 5G will enable. We're rapidly approaching the launch of our first use case for 5G with a roll-up of residential broadband services. As you know, Sacramento and Los Angeles are two of four initial commercial launch market and you heard Lowell earlier announce Houston few minutes ago. News and updates on our full [ph] market will be provided soon.\\n\\nResidential broadband is here the first of many use cases for 5G that will be deployed on our multi-use network. Progress is well on the way across all of the use cases and we remain focused on providing 5G mobility in 2019. I'm super-excited for the future, we're on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution and we have the assets in place to take full advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.\\nNow I will turn the call back over to Brady so we can get to your questions.\\nBrady Connor\\nThank you, Hans. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nLowe, first I'd like to say congrats on your retirement and your career at Verizon, it's been really -- I've really enjoyed working with you over the years. And also quickly for Hans, it will be great working with you as you take the reins going forward. So Lowe, during your tenure as CEO you've really -- Verizon has really stuck to it's core competency of wireless network leadership while other companies have moved to diversify into adjacent areas. How confident are you that this is the right path? And as we look ahead to 5G deployment and adoption, do you believe that Verizon can sort of widen the gap and create a sustainable advantage versus other carriers [ph]? Thanks.\\nLowell McAdam\\nI think your strategy is based on the assets that you have in your portfolio and where you think you can go with a high degree of success. We talk about competing to win, we don't want to play to play, we want to play to win. We've looked at the things that we've done, network leadership is at the core, it's part of the values of the company, every individual here is proud of what we do on network leadership; and we've stayed close to that core, branching out though into things like Verizon Connect and Oath is a very logical near progression for us, and we see the advantages that will strengthen the core going forward. If I look at the things I'm proudest of, it's the things that you mentioned that we've done and pushing the envelope on 5G and 4G are some of those.\\nI also love to say a little bit with a smile on my face, I'm glad we didn't follow a lot of the things the analysts and the bankers told us we had to do and that's put us in a position now that Matt outlined where we've got a strong balance sheet, we've got a clear strategy, and I think we are going to put a significant distance between us and the competition; and the first mover on the network generation changes usually gains a significant amount of market share, and with the assets that we have we think we're in that position with 5G.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\\nSimon Flannery\\nI also wanted to share my best wishes to Lowell, good luck with your retirement. Good to hear the news about Houston; you've talked about a $30 million plus opportunity for the residential broadband, can you just help us think about the pacing of that? How are you thinking about the initial timing of the rollout? How many markets we'll see in terms of pops covered over the next 12-24 months? And then on the mobility side, you're starting to talk about that a bit more, we've heard some of your competitors talk about how many markets to launch this year; how rapidly do you think you're going to roll that out? And is that all going to be microwave or you're going to use some lower balance [ph] for the mobility 5G? Thank you.\\nHans Vestberg\\nSo when it comes to the fixed wireless access, so as I said in the beginning, we will have an initial commercial launch of four markets this year, that's going to be based on our sort of software that we developed in the beginning calling TS [ph]. We are preparing the whole network with Intelligent Edge Network to be ready to launch 5G based on the and/or [ph] standard that is coming out right now; and vendors -- and again, equipment manufacturers and OEMs are preparing right now. So we will be ready as soon as that has the majority to be released to our customers; so that they will come back when we'll go for the full 30 million households which is our own ambitions that we have explained before. So that's where we are on the fixed wireless access.\\n\\nOn the mobility, we do the same. Remember the Intelligent Edge Network is a multi-use network, so it's a same rate base station that is going to provide our fixed wireless access as mobility. So we are and as I said before, I mean we are now in deployment on fiber in more than 50 cities. So we are preparing everything to be ready for the majority of the equipment and the software's as well as having the CPE and handset market ready for launching those products, and right now that's the ambitions we see in 2019, we have not named the cities but as you can here we are deploying in 50 markets with fiber sales [ph], and I think that's an important point of it. So that's where we are and we will come back and give you updates all the time on the new things we're doing and today we're now launching the third city here in Houston, we're super excited over that; so we'll continue to flow all the information on what we're doing on 5G.\\nSimon Flannery\\nAnd when should you launch the first of the Sacramento, LA, Houston? Is that going to be in the third quarter or more likely the fourth?\\nHans Vestberg\\nGood question. Well, as we say -- we say that in the second half of 2018; so we promise we will come out and tell you as soon as we know exactly the date.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nHans, can you talk us through what's happening on the CapEx side to move towards the lower end of the guide; are you doing less this year than you expected or just getting more for it? And where are you in the shift of spending and focus from macro towers to more fiber and small cell? Thanks.\\nHans Vestberg\\nI think this is a great question; remember when I came in -- we decided together with Matt, Lowell and the whole management team to actually flip the whole network to the -- sort of the horizontal Intelligent Edge Network. And I also experienced there were two important factors where we did that; one, we wanted to deliver new type of services based on a horizontal network, especially the ones coming from 5G and we want to see some of them coming up very shortly. The second was that we also could be so much more efficient with new technologies in multipurpose equipment. At the same time we put in the new process for capital efficiency that Matt and I are sharing, and I think that's what you're seeing right now; we are actually doing much more than before when it comes to deployment. Then as we say here, we are already deploying 5G things at the moment, we're preparing all the network for it, so that's embedded in the numbers that you see.\\nAt the same time we also are making a big shift in our whole spending; I mean if I look what we spend in 2017 in the capital result CapEx than in 2018 it's very different; so we're also making shift at all time but this is nothing that we're limiting, we used our more efficient of using our capital and my engineering team are very happy with the investment that we're doing at the moment. So I think that we are also -- as you said, we are moving over to much more small cells than making bigger towers and macro cells. And I will say, if you go back a couple of years ago our -- majority of all our investment was on macro towers and today the majority is on densification with smaller cells. So we have shifted dramatically over the years and I've only been part of it now for more than one year but I've seen how the engineering team is responding to the new way of working and setting up the whole new network structure. So that's what you seen in the figures.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nIf I can follow-up; anything you can tell us given that efficiency about where 2019 CapEx might be upward or downward from 2018? Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nWe'll stay consistent with what we've done in the past where we'll talk about 2019 we get closer to that but I think we've been pretty consistent in our commentary that -- look, we expect CapEx to be reasonably consistent and as we [indiscernible] is to accelerate any spend on 5G as we see it but it's little too early in the process to get there yet. I'll just remind you as Hans said, a lot of the spending that we've been doing around densification supports both 4G and 5G. So the network really is in a great position to be preposition for us moving into 5G here without it requiring a significant step change in total spend. We've done this before, has moved from one generation of technology to another, and keeping total CapEx spend fairly consistent and we're confident we'll do that again.\\n\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.\\nDavid Barden\\nMatt, could I just ask some questions on the finance side, just on the lower tax guide -- could you talk about the reasons why that is and is that flowing through to the cash flow side of the equation, and do we need to address that in the free cash flow number as well? And then the second one is, could you talk about -- I think as we've done historically, some of the changes in the union contracts forthcoming -- how should we think about that impact on the cost structure, I know you gave us about 20% margin in the wireline side for this year but is that -- did those negotiations give you some window in potentially having some upside in that margin number in the wireline business? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nI'll start with the tax question. So, as you look at the first half of the year the ETR [ph] was impacted certainly by tax reform but we had a couple of one-timers in there, especially related to the pension contribution we did in first quarter that you wouldn't see necessarily flow through to the second half of the year, so that's why we're guiding towards the lower end of the 24% to 26% range for the year as a whole. In terms of it flowing through to the cash flow; you know, I would say certainly you should expect cash taxes to be positively impacted this year by tax reform. We didn't have that in the first quarter because we had no scheduled payments; as you know, second quarter we had the first of two scheduled payments for the year and so started to see those flow through, expect to see lower tax rate flow through to our cash tax payments in the rest of the year and that's certainly behind the commentary that we gave around the ability to strengthen the balance sheet this year.\\nSo expect to continue to see the benefit from the lower tax rate. I'll let Lowell answer your question around the new union contract.\\nLowell McAdam\\nDavid, we're really pleased with the relationship that we've built with the union. During the last contract we get together at the senior level very frequently, we've been able to deal with some issues that had been thorns on the side for both, the union leadership and members, as well as the company. So when we decided to attempt to get a contract literally a year ahead of expiration -- that was a major change in our relationship, and I would like to thank the union leadership for the way -- the approach that they took during this. As far as your financial projections; I would say just continue with the projections that you've seen, we do have increases and contributions and that sort of thing but it's not a significant change to the bottom-line trajectory that you've seen the way it was after our last contract. But the beauty of all of this is now the management and all of our employees can focus on our customers and deploying 5G and deploying fiber, and they can all focus on work and their families and the customer instead of getting ready for a strike; and so we're very, very pleased about this outcome.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\\nBrett Feldman\\nThanks. And I'd also like to extend my congrats to Lowell for a distinguished career, and to Hans for the opportunity that lies ahead. I was hoping I could ask about postpaid ARPA; that metric has been under pressure for the last several years although it's shown a lot of stabilization recently. And even though you don't breakout phone ARPU intrinsically, we all know that it was phone ARPU that was causing that pressure as subs moved into EIP, and more recently into the unlimited plans. It seems like the EIP transition or the unsubsidized transition is fully behind us, I'm not entirely sure we are in the migration to the new unlimited plan; so I guess I was just kind of hoping you could talk through the drivers of postpaid ARPA going forward. Do we still have any headwind on the phone side, is that becoming a tailwind? And then of course you've highlighted you are seeing a lot of other devices including wearable's come into your accounts? Are we starting to get to the point where that's becoming a meaningful positive driver on ARPA as well? Thanks.\\n\\nLowell McAdam\\nAs you look ARPA, you're right that the transition to the device payment plans is essentially complete, the year-over-year difference in terms of the percentage of the base unsubsidized pricing is now in single digits as far as a year ago it was much more significant; so that shows up in ARPA. The other good things in the ARPA though is -- you continue to see the demand for our products and services, so we continued in the quarter to have our customers step up in terms of the plans they are on, whether that be from a metered [ph] plan to unlimited or even within our unlimited plans that we offer. And then we continue to see increases in connections per account whether that be wearable's or additional phones on the account; those things are coming through to ARPA and you see the impact there on service revenue overall.\\nSo certainly ARPA is stabilizing and we think as we continue to offer the right plans to customers and we continue to give them the opportunities to add additional devices to their plans that it's an area where we can continue to help drive revenue growth going forward.\\nBrett Feldman\\nHave you broken out how many of your customers are on unlimited plans? I apologize if I missed that.\\nLowell McAdam\\nWe have not. As we said previously between unlimited and our Verizon 2.0 plans where customers have the ability to control over Edge, that would be significantly above 50% and certainly the number of customers unlimited continues to grow but we haven't broken that out at this point but it's becoming certainly a larger and larger percentage at the base.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.\\nMichael Rollins\\nFirst on the strategic side; as I listened to the management commentary over the past year -- is the underlying goal for Verizon to become a leading provider of broadband in the home and on the go across the country? And if this is the direction how long would it take and how much can be driven by internal investments versus possible M&A? And then just one thing on the business trends; postpaid phone were at the industry level has risen more than twice the rate of population growth, do you have any thoughts on what's driving this change and the sustainability for postpaid phones at this new level of growth? Thanks.\\nHans Vestberg\\nMaybe I can start with the network question that you had on broadband. I think when I look into the assets we have and I've been now working here for quite a while; I really like the assets we have and the ones we're building, that will give us the opportunity to be much larger, broader than providing and I think the announcement that we did today that we now are having using it as well and we will continue without communication on the new cities we are going to deploy on; 5G gave us that opportunity. But we need to remember when we talk about 5G -- 5G is an access technology, there is so much more you need to do to actually have it, when I look what we are doing all the way from the data center with fiber unified transport, multi-service routers, they are all way -- I see that this is a big undertaking but we are in the midst of it and I've said a couple of times before -- I mean we have been onto this Intelligent Edge Network right now for quite a while and we see the benefits and we see the opportunity that is great.\\nSo you're right, of course it's going to take time to have it across the country but as I mentioned, we're already now deploying fiber in 50 cities. So we will come back and give you more color to it but I think we are preparing the network to be really using the networks and levering the efficiency markets; so that's for us a very important piece of it.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nOn the postpaid phone, you know we continue to see consumer demand there. And we believe certainly we'll give customers the opportunity to get on the nation's best network and we have the right price plans, we see good things happen there; so I can't comment in terms of the industry volumes overall but we certainly continue to see good consumer demand and we expect to continue to have postpaid phone net growth going forward, and we'll see how that plays out across the rest of the industry. One other comment I'll just add on the network side is, in addition to the broadband pace -- as we've talked about the strategy, it's -- once you have that pace what we -- the services that we can provide above that connectivity layer are also very important as we go forward, and we think we're in a great place to be able to deliver on that too. So hopefully that helps your questions, Mike.\\n\\nLowell McAdam\\nAnd Mike, I think I'd just add one thing; it's funny when you're at this point in your career you get to look back and you see an awful lot of similar questions but just asked in a different way; I remember when we brought Verizon together back in '99 and we had about 20% market penetration on postpaid and there was no smartphone and people were saying, where is the industry going, you can't possibly get anymore penetration than you've gotten. And at that point I pointed to areas like Sweden, Hans's home country that was at 50% penetration, and we're -- see we've got all sorts of headroom and now we're over 100% penetration and you see wearable's, and with 5G, and Hans mentioned this, and I mentioned it in my opening remarks, you're going to see so much more penetration on all of the different business applications that are going to change people's lives.\\nI really don't think much about postpaid or smartphones or any category you want to look at as an opportunity for future growth, there are so many things that we have literally 0% penetration on today that are going to be big businesses five years from now; that's why I'm so excited to see the way we're positioned and the leadership teams philosophy around dealing with customer pain points and providing on the products that they're going to need that will be indispensable five years from now; so that's my perspective on that.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.\\nCraig Moffett\\nGood morning, and let me join the parade of people saying congratulations to Lowell, it really has been a pleasure and also congratulations to you, Hans, I look forward to your great success. Let me ask a strategic question about video if I could; you've discontinued go90 in the quarter, there have at least been press reports about -- at least some discussion about how you move forward with Oath and whether Oath addressable advertising might actually be more successful outside the company instead of inside the company. I wonder if you could just talk about the role that you see video playing -- and now that you've had some time to play around with some of the different strategies around video and addressable advertising, and then as part of that if you could specifically comment on the situation in the press reports about Oath that would be helpful.\\nLowell McAdam\\nLet me deal with those in reverse order there Craig and then I'll let Hans come in and put a period on it. The questions around Oath -- I don't know where they're coming from. There is no intention of spinning out Oath in any particular format. We see the synergies that we expected to see and we see the future that we had hoped for. Matt talked about in his remarks the integration efforts that are going on, they are on-schedule, and so we see no reason to do that and there's no credible report out there that are otherwise in my view. So I'd be clear about that.\\nOn the video side, look that is the major driver of traffic that we see on the network today; we only expect that to go up overtime. But we're not fans of linear but I'm not trying to criticize anybody else's strategy here, it's just the fact of the assets that we have and the investments that we want to make, it's much better in our view to do digital; so we're -- as we've always said skating to where the puck is going, so that's where we're focused. I was very heartened by our time in Sun Valley two weeks ago, Hans went and we met with all of the major content providers, the sports leagues, healthcare, education, gaming, all of those segments and every one of them when they know what is going on with 5G, and especially, the latency certainly along with the capacity but when they see the latency their eyes light up about what's possible.\\n\\nSo my view is, and I know Hans shares this -- we've developed these strategies together, he has always been one of my go-to-guys over the last five years to see where the industry is going but it's our belief that we're positioned perfectly to have the partnerships that we need to be successful; we're not going to be owning contents or we're not going to be competing with other content providers, we're going to be their best partner from a distribution perspective and I think that makes great sense for the company going forward.\\nHans Vestberg\\nAnd I can [indiscernible], I've been around now for quite a while, both as leading this but I've been seating together with Lowell, the management team, and the board on the strategic decision we've done and I'm fully onboard on all of them. And when I look at the assets we have, I'm really happy with them and I'm encouraged to see what we can do with them both, leverage them. And we also are going to get more of the synergies that Lowell talked about all of them [ph], and just talking about the Oath, for example; I mean today with the massive confidence we have in Oath when it comes to AIML [ph] and we are in the transformation of our network to virtualization that's a great synergy and creating a lot of newer possibilities for us on the front and we're constantly working how we can actually leverage our assets on our sort of the Verizon side and Oath side and we will continue to find those ways forward.\\nSo I feel good about the assets we have and I agree with Lowell that -- and we can partner with anyone and again, we are betting on that, we're going to have the best network, Intelligent Edge Network, we want to have a great 5G, the best; and of course, we can attract partners that we can work with and I think that is the model that we have and that we can continue to develop. And I see only opportunities when we go to 5G when you can build to connectivity platforms and applications, and sort of define where you're going to play in that or where you're going to have partners. So I'm feeling encouraged about the assets we have and what we can do with them.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo.\\nJennifer Fritzsch\\nCan I just explore the wireline CapEx component -- it's down about $500 million from the first quarter and yet I hear you're doing it 50 fiber [ph] cities. Can you talk Matt maybe about the -- should we begin to see that wireline portion of that CapEx ramp as this fiber build comes together? And then I guess what does that mean for what I'll call traditional wireless spend? And then just separately on millimeter ways background, we do have an auction coming up in November, you guys have a lot of spectrum here; can you comment on interest if that might be part of your focus from the fall [ph]?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nSo on the CapEx side, certainly as you look between first and second quarter you got timing in there; but as we build out fiber and as you say, we mentioned the 50 cities outside of the ILEC footprint where we're deploying fiber today -- you'll see a blurring of the line of the CapEx between the segments, so obviously that fiber build shows up in our wireline segment but the largest customer for that build is the wireless piece of the business, so this is part of densifying the network, prepositioning the network to not just excel in 4G but also be ready for 5G, especially using millimeter wave spectrum as you mentioned. So I would expect to see a continuation of those spend but the total CapEx number as I said earlier, you should see consistency there, and as you -- what you're seeing is the continued evolution of our CapEx from one generation of technology to the next, and fiber build out is a key component of that. So you should expect to see a continuation of those trends and as part of the Intelligent Edge Network that will deliver 5G, and we're excited about it as we go forward.\\n\\nAnd I'll let Hans talk about millimeter wave.\\nHans Vestberg\\nWhen we think about data usage of our network we usually talk in a couple of different ways in order to define what we need, and first of all we have the choice between densifying and deploying on more spectrum, I think that the last round of Oath spectrum we decided to densify and I think that is now paying out very well for us. Secondly, looking to all new type of technology and features coming out in a network that can optimize everything from carrier engagement, etcetera. And lastly, we of course look into what spectra we need to have; that is putting us in a very disciplined way how we use these three type of assets when we decide what to do in order to have the best return-on-investment. Of course, we are looking into any auction that's coming up and see how that fits in in that pattern of decision-making with these different type of options, so we will look into that.\\nHowever, we're also feeling pretty good about the position we have on millimeter wave right now; but again, we will look into if there are any holes we need to feel in this process but again, it will be in that discussion all the way from densification, looking into new features on the technology, and then looking into what spectrum is needed, and then we have the disciplined approach to our return-on-investment.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Matthew Nicknam [ph] of Deutsche Bank.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOne, on 5G, what are you hearing from your larger commercial enterprise customers in terms of demand for specific use cases? I'm wondering if that can facilitate any sort of acceleration in your pace of builds heading into next year? And then secondly, maybe for Matt on tax reform, you talked about using the benefits this year at least to strengthen the balance sheet; how should we think about optimal leverage for the business today? And how do the uses of access cash and tax reform benefits -- how do I potentially evolve into 2019?\\nLowell McAdam\\nLet's start with the 5G and enterprise; you're right, when we think about the eight different currencies that 5G is going to explore or we'll have -- I think that enterprise is the receiver [indiscernible] when it comes to latency, security, launched throughputs and all of that. We are in constant dialogue with our enterprise customers to see how we can build new type of services with them, and of course, we were building the Intelligent Edge Network and here we have the definition of Edge, how we do a specific slice for an enterprise, and that could be private 5G network with low latency or something like that. So we see that as a great opportunity, there are some features if I be little bit deep on technology that come out on the next revision of the N or 5G technology which is on the sick revision 16 [ph], that will be even more important for our enterprise customer. But again, we are building these as we speak and we have dialogue with all our enterprise customers to see that we are actually innovating together with them, new type of service where you sort of doing your real-time enterprise based on wireless which haven't been done before. So I think we are very far on our innovation and exploration in this area and I see great opportunities in it.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nOn your question around tax reform and certainly flowing through the cash flow and the capital allocation; look, the capital allocation we've talked about this numerous times and we are focused on being able to invest in the networks, providing a return to our shareholders, we know the dividend is important and we've increased the dividend for 11 years in a row now, and we've also said we want to strengthen the balance sheet and get back to those pre-Vodafone credit rating profile, and certainly tax reform helps accelerate our ability to do that, that's our focus for 2018. You saw good progress in the first half of the year, not just on the debt paydown but also -- when we say we strengthen the balance sheet we include what we did with the pension contribution as well; so we're making good progress there, too early to give specific views on 2019 but certainly as you know, tax reform will help us get to those leverage profile's quicker than we would have done otherwise and look forward to updating you on 2019 when we get closer to it.\\n\\nBrady Connor\\nThanks, Matt. Brad, we have time for one more question, let's go and take one more please.\\nOperator\\nYour last question comes from Tim Hurrian [ph] of Oppenheimer.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nDo you still think you're going to be able to use wireless customer data in terms of location and usage to do more targeted advertising -- and if so, kind of the timing on that? And then secondly, it does seem like wireless and wireline networks are converging; I'm just curious, how do the unions kind of feel about this? Do you have the flexibility to kind of really converge these networks in a timely basis? Thank you.\\nLowell McAdam\\nOkay Tim, thanks for the question, and I'd just say to all of you that asked questions today, thank you for your best wishes. First, on customer data, our hallmark on this Tim is transparency; we don't want to use data though -- unless customers know how we're using it. And so far we've been able to do a broad data analysis and target our advertising not based on individual customer data but overall data. And I think that anonymous usage -- we're very clear with customers about, and it's certainly got a lot of value to the old facets. On the convergence side, we're honoring the contract within the footprint and we're very open with the union about what we're doing, and we're very clear that areas that we manage outside of the union contract will stay clean as we go forward. So again, transparency is important to us, we think we can do exactly what we need to do without causing any footfalls and we're open about it; so we don't view that as a hindrance to our strategy going forward.\\nBrady Connor\\nThat's all the time we have for questions today. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Hans for some closing comments.\\nHans Vestberg\\nThank you, Brady. And I would like to close this call with a few key points as I prepare to start my tenure as CEO of Verizon but I have to start by thanking Lowell for a fantastic journey and the fantastic job you have done, and you're going to be here in the transition and I'm really grateful for that. And yesterday like this when we're in the field, here in Houston, meeting employees, investors, we're meeting partners, and of course the city -- I think it shows the relationship you have built over the years, and handing that over to me and the team I think is enormous. So I have to chime-in [ph] towards everybody, as I said, it's a fantastic journey you've had Lowell.\\nAnd coming back to the first half of 2018 where we've achieved solely financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace, and we are -- we're pleased where the business is positioned as we start the second half of the year. And we remain focused on the core strength of developing superior customer relationship and building the next-generation network for long-term growth, and I've talked about Intelligent Edge Network and the importance for our business, and I'm pleased to see where we're all with that.\\nWe're also committed to our strategy, and prior [ph] just led by investing in our network, leveraging the assets across all of Verizon, using platforms such as Oath to further monetize data and video consumption, maintaining disciplined capital allocation process and creating value for our customers and shareholders. We're confident in our ability to execute on our strategy, and we're positioned to take full advantage of the many opportunities that will take shape as we lead the evolution into 5G. As we say at Verizon, we don't wait for the future, we build it.\\nThank you for time today.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect.\\n\", '/article/4174495-verizon-communications-vz-presents-moffettnathanson-5th-annual-media-and-communications': 'Verizon Communications, Inc. (NYSE:VZ) MoffettNathanson 5th Annual Media & Communications Summit Conference May 14, 2018  8:00 AM ET\\nExecutives\\nHans Vestberg - EVP, President of Global Networks and CTO\\nAnalysts\\nCraig Moffett - MoffettNathanson\\nHans Vestberg\\nThank you. Great to be here. A little bit cold like wind and almost...\\nCraig Moffett\\nSome of you will remember that -- I think it was either last year or the year before that the air conditioning in this room broke.\\nHans Vestberg\\nNot this time.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd I think that -- well, I think that the hotel is still doing their level best to make up for that by averaging down over a period of years. So first of all, I also want to thank the people who have joined us via webcast. Before we dig in to the details of your network now, I want to start with a question that goes back a little bit, to the moment, just about a year ago, when Verizon made the -- what was then surprise announcement that you were going unlimited. At the time, the broad consensus was that your network wouldn’t be able to handle it and that the network would fail. What gave you confidence at the time that the network was prepared? And in retrospect, how well has it fared?\\nHans Vestberg\\nOkay. Before I start and to meet the requirement from my team, to cover the safe harbor statement, I might say something that is forward-looking, who knows. I don’t plan it, but given your questions, nobody knows. So take that into consideration to whatever I’m saying.\\nSo I think that what gave me the confidence of doing the unlimited -- I’m not saying because I wasn’t even there. I had worked 1 year. This was a decision taken before I came in. But what I can tell you is that when Verizon launched unlimited, there had been a lot of work done before. I mean, you cannot fix that in 1 month and saying that we have a great network, let’s launch unlimited. It has been a long, hard work of the engineering team to put the network together to be able to do it. And I have to say, an amazing performance of the network since unlimited. I mean, first of all, you need to understand that if you go to unlimited, of course, we got the spike. I mean, a lot of the users using a lot of data came over and started using that. So for a while, you have a spike, and I think that the team handled that very well. And then after that, what you see is that then you come back to normal and track your old data growth that you had before. So over the period, in the beginning, you have a spike and then you come back to the same growth. At the same time, we had the tool kit or things that I’ve talked about at our sell-side meeting in November. Everything from carrier aggregation, new antennas, we had new basebands coming in, all of that were enhancing our capacity and, of course, doing densification at the same time. So what you can see after almost a year of it is that, first of all, we performed best in all the service that have been done during all this time, and we are ahead of the curve. We have a lot of capacity in the network, and we still have a lot of tools that we can put into the network. We’re only using half of our spectrum before this deal. So I think that the combination of great engineering and planning ahead, so that’s why we performed well.\\nCraig Moffett\\nHow far -- when you say planning ahead, how far out are you planning in -- for individual cell sites and for the network overall?\\nHans Vestberg\\nLong. I mean, we, of course, make assumptions, planning that goes years out in order to understand how the growth is and how we do the planning. Then, we have to correct if something changes. And some changes came in due to unlimited because we saw data usage outside peak hours. We saw our customers using the network instead of Wi-Fi in other sort of regions than normal. So of course, there were some assumptions, but clearly, we do forecasting on our data on a very detailed level. And then we plan how to do it using all the tools we have. I mean, when you talk about capacity, you always -- almost end up in spectrum. But remember also, you have a lot of tools, you have densification. And that combination, when you do the economics of it, that’s really what makes the difference.\\n\\nCraig Moffett\\nWell, we’re going to come to that in a second.\\nHans Vestberg\\nWe’ll come to that.\\nCraig Moffett\\nI want to ask a question of the audience first. Obviously, a quick show of hands. How many people in the audience think that Verizon needs more spectrum?\\nHans Vestberg\\nOkay. Now we’re down.\\nCraig Moffett\\nIt’s funny because I’ve seen that question asked before and where the vast majority of hands go up. And it seems like the -- if that’s any indication, it seems like the audience has moved off a little bit of the view that Verizon is spectrum constrained. But can you just talk about that? Can you talk about, from a high-level perspective, how you think about the trade-off between spectrum and those other tools?\\nHans Vestberg\\nSo first of all, it goes back to each and every service provider because we’re all different. We are sitting on our spectrum 115, 116 megahertz on what we today call mid-band. We define that in the market. And we have over 1,000 megahertz on millimeter wave. Let’s talk about position. Now of course, we already decided a couple of years ago that densification was more economical than, in some cases, buying spectrum. So of course, we’re densified. And then, of course, what you see on top of that is an enormous new set of tools coming out from the network, everything from carrier aggregation, new antenna sets, 256-QAM, all these fantastic acronyms. When we put all these together -- and then the last piece, which we sometimes tend to forget, is also global standards because if you have global standard for equipment or handsets, that means also you get benefit of a lot of things in network. Those four things we put together in our financial model every time we think about, Okay, here we have a projection 18 months out, we’re probably going to have some constraints on capacity. What is the best way to solve it? Remember, also now, we’re coming in with unlicensed band, coming in like LAA and an all of that. So many things about what is the best to do. And remember, it hangs all the way from the equipment to the handset. So you can do a lot of great things in the network, but if there are no handsets, you’re idling the capacity because nobody can use it. So it has to be a combination of that to work together.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd you still got a lot of spectrum left to be dedicated -- even before we talk about 5G left to be dedicated to LTE. Can you talk about that, sort of where we are in that process?\\nHans Vestberg\\nRoughly -- I would say roughly -- we’re using roughly 50% of our mid-band -- what we call mid-band portfolio today. So half of it is left, and we are constantly moving that thing where we see it’s needed. But at the same time, we do densification as well. So yes, we have quite a lot of spectrum left on that.\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo Cathy and I wrote about a year ago that the value of spectrum has to be viewed through the lens of the cost of all of those alternatives, particularly the spectrum reuse technology like densification. More precisely, we said that the amount of capacity that can be created by $1 spent on network densification that -- as the amount of capacity rises, almost by definition that means that the value of spectrum is, therefore, falling. At the time, that was a pretty controversial argument, to say that network densification is driving down the cost -- or the value of spectrum. Do you agree with that? Do you think the value of spectrum, particularly mid-band spectrum, is rising? Or is it falling? And do you think that investor expectations about spectrum valuations are appropriate?\\nHans Vestberg\\nI think that, first of all, it depends on which service provider you are because, again, it depends on what assets you have. So for certain, the value might have gone up. For others, it might go down. So I’m not here to speculate what I think in general. But I think that’s an important thing, what spectrum holdings you have and how much densification you have, what type of handsets you have in the -- with your customers. All that makes a place where you sit down and say, Should I buy some spectrum? Or should I continue with densification? Put in -- I mean, think also about the technology evolution -- or let’s say revolution. About three, four years ago, carrier aggregation did not exist. And for the ones that don’t have all the technology acumen here, carrier aggregation is basically one spectrum together with another. You combine them, and that becomes one road instead of having two separate roads. \\n\\nToday, you can do carrier aggregation up to maybe six different frequencies. It is an enormous capacity improvement. So when you sit and think about, Should I do carrier aggregation on five bands? Or should I buy a spectrum? That becomes an economical model you need around. Then, of course, you need to understand that the handsets or the device you’re planning needs to have the same type of thing. All the time, you’re sitting and doing those type of things. And of course, what we don’t know is how much more the technology will evolve. But just looking backwards, how much we have learned of doing better spectrum efficiency in five years, if we have the same track the next five years, there’s -- lots more things you will do with a spectrum. And I’m confident -- where I come from, I worked for a company that worked only with spectrum efficiency every day for the last 140 years. So of course, there are billions of dollars going into spectrum efficiency every day because that’s what they do for business, and they are working for us and for some others as well, I guess.\\nCraig Moffett\\nWell, I remember it was an extraordinary realization that over the last five years, for the U.S. as -- the whole country, not any individual carrier, but for the U.S. as a country, increases in spectrum over the last five years only accounted for 0.7% of the increase in capacity of the network. It’s really an extraordinary statistic.\\nHans Vestberg\\nI think that’s a very good comment. I don’t know the exact number, but I think you saw it. Just imagine if we were still rounding on CDMA and GSM, which was 1 band carrier, you cannot do anything else. With all the data we have, it would be impossible, even though -- with all the spectrum in the market.\\nCraig Moffett\\nYes, that’s right. And so the solution wasn’t spectrum. The solution has been everything other than spectrum, yes. Now there’s -- I want to stay with this topic of spectrum valuations for a second because you made a comment earlier that you had started to come -- you, Verizon, because this is a little bit even before you had arrived, had started to come to the realization that spectrum values in the auctions were becoming less attractive than network densification. Can you talk about that institutionally, how that knowledge began to be syndicated within the company and where it started and how -- sort of how it evolved in the thinking of Verizon?\\nHans Vestberg\\nOf course, I don’t have that corporate memory because I wasn’t there. But I guess, it was a calculation of how much would it cost for you to densify -- especially where you have the most data loads, which is in urban area, what would it cost you to densify there instead of buying spectrum. And I guess, in some cases then, for certain cities, it turned out, Hey, it’s more efficient for us actually to do densification. And we’re sitting here now, I guess, it’s three, four years, since it happened, and that was a great strategy. And I can only tell the guys in engineering, they did a good job and they had made a good decision.\\nCraig Moffett\\nBut now you have to feel like a kid in a candy store all of a sudden because now I’m going to defeat everything I ...\\nHans Vestberg\\n[indiscernible] it’s a great company.\\nCraig Moffett\\nBut if I think about the amount of spectrum that looks like it might be coming to market, so there’s not only -- we’ve got some of the individual potential sellers like DISH network and SES and Intelsat and the C-band or alternative proposals for the C-band. The FCC is working on the CBRS band. There’s an upcoming auction on 28 and 24. There are smaller players like Ligado that has been, potentially, sellers for a while. I think it suddenly seems like there is -- I wouldn’t call it a spectrum glut but I would say there’s a lot of potential sellers. And one of the interesting things is that, for almost every one of those sellers, the broad consensus from the investment community is that the buyer is Verizon. So can you talk about that? Can you talk about -- does the availability of more spectrum whet your appetite to say there might be an opportunity for -- suddenly for spectrum values that it’s suddenly a buyer’s market for spectrum and it might change the calculus of...\\n\\nHans Vestberg\\nAs I said before, it’s always a balance between what it will cost compared to the other tool sets you have, densification, carrier aggregation, all the things I’ve talked about. And then remember also, another thing you need to think about is the global ecosystem of the spectrum, do you have the equipment on that or if you don’t have equipment on it, then you need make it manageable all the time. You don’t want to end up to be alone on the spectrum in the world. Usually, they don’t have the economies of scale, so you wouldn’t out rule it. It might be a moment where you say, hey, the benefit is better on having more spectrum than continuing with all the tools we have, churning in new phones and all of that. So we will do that evaluation all the time and see what is the best for the company. And we have very, very detailed models for doing that down on basically the lowest entity and checking because, ultimately, it could be cities, it could be regions and, to some extent, seldom a nation that you’re looking into, but then you’re looking into how you do that best in that place. And so it’s going to be an economic and a financial modeling we’re going to do.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd what are the characteristics of spectrum that are most valuable? It used to be just frequency. It used to be low frequency was better, and higher frequency was worse. But now there’s all these other characteristics of whether or not you have wide bands, particularly for 5G where the width of the band makes the difference. You talked about whether it’s available in DMAs or in PEAs or how large the coverage areas are. Talk about some of those characteristics and what makes spectrum, to you, more attractive now. What are the characteristics you’re most interested in?\\nHans Vestberg\\nI was part of the initial planning and thoughts around 5G even though I wasn’t the one doing it, but, of course, the company I worked for, and that was 2009. Remember then, when you started to design 5G, it was designed for industries and for society. Consumers had all the things they needed, and that was the idea and, of course, any benefit you will have. So that was also designed that the throughput should be 1,000x faster. You should get down -- come down to millimeter, milliseconds of latency. You could serve 1,000 times more IoT devices in a cell. All of that was designed in order to get the industries to use wireless technology for their industrial transformation. And then, of course -- and to make that happen, you need big chunks of spectrum. That’s clear because some of these characteristics are impossible to do with 10x10 or something. So of course, it has changed then. So because -- when we’re sitting with 4G, looked at the use cases for that, then you -- the mid-band was the most important. Data throughput, a couple of megabits was important. Here, we talk about gigabit, for example. So yes, that has changed also the view on which spectrums are important when you go and deliver services. But again, it also depends on what type of customers you have. I go to Verizon. We have more medium enterprise -- we have enterprise customers, we have wholesale customers, we have IT customers, we have wireless customers. So of course, we are playing in all the needs of that type of spectrum. And that’s also why we came to the conclusion that millimeter wave is a very\\ngood fit for us, for example, that we now have in our portfolio.\\nCraig Moffett \\nYes. I want to talk about millimeter wave for a second because, certainly, if we were sitting in this chair in the first summit five years ago, no one would have talked about millimeter wave as a workable wave -- as a workable frequency. And in fact, in those days, there was a very clear delineation of above 2 gigahertz were considered high frequency.\\n\\nHans Vestberg \\nCorrect.\\nCraig Moffett \\nI suspect that just because of talking about millimeter wave for the last few years, we have come to conceptually think about 2, 3, 4, 5 gigahertz frequencies very differently. We’ve now started to call them mid-band as a convenience. But the physics of those frequencies haven’t changed at\\nall over five years. They’re still what the physics were. Can you talk about how you think about -- is kind of high, medium, low still the right way to think about it?\\nHans Vestberg \\nYes. I think, to some extent, you can think like that. You’re correct. I just want to correct you some because you say that the physics of the spectrum is the same but the technology advancement, how you use the spectrum has taken huge steps in order to how to use millimeter wave, and I agree with you. I mean, even five years ago, initial research on millimeter wave, we were doing and said, okay, it might work. Today, it’s totally different. We see equipment coming out on millimeter wave. You see handsets coming out soon, etcetera. That is what we think about. So that’s why I come back to the question, how would I look at millimeter five years from now, where we have a global ecosystem rounding on that? So -- but the physics is a little bit different. I mean, high band, high up will have a shorter ranger of coverage but a throughput that is enormous. Of course, you can have big chunks of spectrum. And of course, if you’re in a very low band, you get the long coverage but a very narrow spectrum chunk, which means that getting high speeds and throughput is very hard. So yes, those physics are the same.\\nCraig Moffett \\nWhat about the physics of penetration and absorption? So I’ve almost -- I sort of think it may be more sensible, instead of thinking primarily about propagation distances, to think about spectrum that passes through obstructions, spectrum that is absorbed by obstructions or spectrum that ricochets off of obstructions. And one of the things that makes 5G interesting in millimeter wave is that it tends to ricochet around and find a multipath route to an antenna. Do the high -- what we used to call high frequency but now we’ve started to, I think, lazily lump into mid-band, is that -- does that spectrum suffer by virtue of the fact that it doesn’t actually ricochet for that multipath benefits that you get from millimeter wave?\\nHans Vestberg\\nI think they’re going to live in harmony because you need all of them. But you’re right, the millimeter wave have totally different physics on how it moves around and it reflects in between and can find its way around, and others have less of that. But I think the combination of them -- and just imagine a carrier aggregation in between them, what power you can get out and how much benefit you will get from indoor as well because [indiscernible] release of the spectrums when you have better outdoors. So the combination of that, that’s sort of what we are looking at and how we think we can benefit tremendously from millimeter wave.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd one last question about these widths of blocks that you were just talking about, does -- it used to be that when you were talking about launching a new technology, almost by definition you have to get new spectrum for it, and it had to be moved on that. With carrier aggregation, it’s now possible to strip off little pieces of old spectrum and refarm it a little bit at a time instead of these kind of big, massive refarming decisions. Does that change the way you think about acquiring new spectrum? Is it less important now? I know for 5G, you need big blocks. But for just the way you think about spectrum, are the big blocks less necessary?\\nHans Vestberg\\nYes. You get the benefit of the carrier aggregation that you haven’t thought about before and again, that technology evolution in the last couple of years, which you need to evaluate. The same thing goes also if you think about 5G. I mean, 5G, when that will come, will come in different releases. Those releases -- 5G releases on software, they will be for all spectrum over time. So as we moved everything from 3G to 4G, that’s going to be 4G to 5G as well on any spectrum. It’s just that they’re going to perform very differently if you’re doing it on a low band to a mid-band to a high band. So of course, ultimately, you move -- if release 15 or release 16 on 5G is coming, you move all of the base on that because you want to have unique software on your whole network. You don’t want to have different type of softwares.\\n\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo I want to turn now to network densification because you’ve talked a lot about how that’s become a larger and larger part of your strategy. And densification, obviously, can mean a lot of things. It just means more cell sites, but it can mean more antennas per site. It can -- with MIMO and Massive MIMO. But how is -- the prospect of 5G and using millimeter waves with sort of propagation, how’s that changed Verizon’s densification strategy? And how do you think about planning for small cells in a world where you’re not just planning for densification of LTE but you’re planning for years down the road now?\\nHans Vestberg\\nSo if you think about the very urban area, you’re densifying there because that’s where you have the most of the traffic, like in New York, for example. So of course, if you think about -- come back to your physics of the different spectrums, if you then have millimeter wave, you tend to need fewer of those sites because millimeter wave will capture so much traffic on that distance. Because you have already densified, so you have already moved all the cell sites much closer to each other. And that’s -- for 4G, when you are on those bands, it’s less propagation than millimeter wave. So of course, we need to rethink a little bit where we’re now coming to that phase of it, and we have been on to our densification for many years. So I think that is a part of the broader sort of change we are doing to the whole network where we go from -- remember, we have, let’s say, at least visually, vertical networks where we have the joint venture with Vodafone, so we couldn’t even share equipment. So what we have right now is we are building the Intelligent Edge network, which is a horizontal network where, basically, everything from the data center up to the access is the same equipment for any of our customers. It’s a huge transformation. And then at the edge, we decide what type of access is best for the customer. If it’s an enterprise customer, it could be fiber; if it’s a consumer for wireless. It might be 4G, it might be 5G in the future. It could be gPhone for some. And that’s basically how it works right now, which is very different from how it worked before. And then densification is one part of it, depending on what type of customers you have in that area.\\nCraig Moffett\\nCan you put any numbers around it for us in terms of -- you’ve been at this longer than any of your competitors. I know it’s even a hard question to answer, how many small cells there are, because there are so many different flavors of depth and what have you. But can you put any rough numbers around the number of small cells deployed over the last three, four, five years?\\nHans Vestberg\\nNo.\\nCraig Moffett\\nOkay.\\nHans Vestberg\\nYou should measure our network on the wireless. I mean, we have performed the best as long as I have followed Verizon. And so of course, lots of densification done. And you’re right, because you comment yourself I mean, if you probably get the [indiscernible], that’s not important here. The important is you build a network that performs the best and then you use all the tools. And we are using all the tools and we’ll continue. So talking about how many small cells you have is not relevant. It depends on. What tools you have in a network, how much densification have you done, what spectrum are you using. Those types of things are important to get the performance, not one individual, single thing you’re seeing on the network. And that’s what we think holistically in all our decision financially, how we deploy and how the engineering thinks when we’re doing this.\\nCraig Moffett\\nYou made a splash a year or so I guess maybe a little over a year or so ago, talking about 1,700 strands of fiber in your preferred fiber backhaul solution.\\n\\nHans Vestberg\\nIt was my boss.\\nCraig Moffett\\nCan you talk about that kind of concept though as to how you think about the backhaul piece of the network?\\nHans Vestberg\\nNo, we have been on to fiber deployment for quite a while. And basically, already years ago, we were driving fiber to all our sites. And of course, you already mentioned, that’s because the fiber is the cheapest here in the whole equation because everything else, the digging and things are the most expensive. So of course, you have all the dimensions. You are ready for whatever 5G will come and what type of traffic it would need to have. So I think when I think about 5G, even fiber is a crucial element for it. I think spectrum is also. Remember, what’s the cost of millimeter wave. Especially if you want to have the real 5G use cases, you need millimeter wave. The other thing you need, you need also central offices because, ultimately, you’re going to have thousands of small data centers that can do things. You need to have that. And finally, you also need to have been virtualizing the network, taking out hardware and software because that enables you. And you need AI, ML and all those components as well. And we are, of course, fortunate to have the whole Yahoo! team and AOL team that has been working with AI and ML for a long time. So all those four components will be super quick to get when you to 5G, and I think we are sitting on all four of them.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd the last topic before we turn to what everybody wants to talk about, 5G, the last topic on network densification...\\nHans Vestberg\\nWhat’s more important than 5G?\\nCraig Moffett\\nTalk about siting small sites because there’s been a lot of talk both in the FCC, we’re going to be talking to Commissioner Rosenworcel this afternoon. There’s been a lot of talk about trying to streamline the process for siting and the location of small cells. What’s been your experience of how long that process takes in different jurisdictions? And what are the competencies...\\nHans Vestberg\\nIt’s very, I can tell you it’s quite dramatically. I think that what is important is you need to have a portfolio of sort of tools when you will come to the densification. I mean, you have one where you deploy your cells, you make agreements with the owners of the posts or whatever it might be. Another is, of course, you use third parties. A third one is like we’re doing in Sacramento. You have a public-private partnership where you -- basically, you get shorter lead times, but at the same time also, you deploy certain technologies for the society or for the city. So I think we’re working with all of them. But what is most important, you need to know every system, every community because legislation is different. If somebody is going to streamline, of course, it’s great. But finally, you need to know each and every place and work in each and every place to make that happen.\\nCraig Moffett \\nAnd do you think that’s a competitive advantage for Verizon? Do you think -- I’ve heard it said that you have much better relationships with...\\nHans Vestberg \\nRelationship is always something intangible for me. But what I see, what we have on the ground in all these places, that means a big difference. Then I hope and I believe that we have good relationships. And we’re a respectful company, and we’re a great partner. So that I hope -- but that’s intangible for me. What is tangible are people, organizations that have done it years and years and they were replicated. I mean, one thing that I saw when I came into Verizon is, of course, you can have certain competitive advantages. One is scale, scale in volume, etcetera, nothing -- we have certain, but can also have a scale in skills, your skills that you replicate again and again, again. And I think that, I have seen a lot, how we deploy, we replicate the best practices from another city, we replicate the way we do densification, how we interact with the city, we use people that knows. And I think that is a competitive advantage for us, and we should just continue to do that as good as we can.\\n\\nCraig Moffett \\nSo I want to turn the conversation now to your fixed wireless broadband plans, which has been, I think, safe to say, one of the most controversial topics, not just...\\nHans Vestberg \\nControversial topic?\\nCraig Moffett \\nNot just for Verizon but for the whole sector. So about six months ago, you said the addressable market for -- at your Analyst Day, back in -- I think it was either late November or December, the addressable market for fixed wireless broadband is about 30% of the country. How did you arrive at that estimate? And what are the characteristics of a market that make it qualify to be part of that 30%?\\nHans Vestberg \\nSo one thing you need to understand before you answer that question is how do 5G work because 5G is basically the technology and it’s a baseband that can handle different use cases at the same time. So one needs to understand, first of all, it’s not a fixed wireless access network being built, it’s a 5G network. And one slice is fixed wireless access. Another is mobility. The third one can be enterprise solutions on milliseconds or it could be a private 5G network. All that is the same equipment. And I just want to go back to the Intelligent Edge Network that we’re building. All the blocks are the same up to the access. So it’s not a special network built for fixed wireless access. It’s the same baseband physically, the same software handling different slices. One more design principle in 5G is that you can do slices on different use cases. And you can handle it -- when it comes to the handsets, you can even handle different slices in the handset. Up to 8, I think, is in release 15 or 16, probably next [Indiscernible] I’m wrong, but somewhere around that. So that is important before you come to your question. And then you asked me, how did you arrive to the 30 million? We need -- of course, we need a bottom up and a top down look into how we’re going to deploy, where we’re going to see a potential use case, what have we learned from millimeter wave. All that, we weighed in when we made that calculation. So that’s how we did it. But the most important question is the first one. It’s a multiuse network. It’s a multiuse radio base station. It’s not -- because in all other fixed wireless access sort of in the history, and I had been part of many of them, they are a single radio base station that is totally disconnected from the rest of the network.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd that means the backhaul and everything else have to be thought of as -- in those cases, have to be thought of as separate, whereas you’re doing it as a shared infrastructure.\\nHans Vestberg\\nIt is exactly the same base stations, that, \"Hey, in this area -- in this room, we’re doing mobility for all of you, and you can run around waiting for 5G.\" But at the same time, I heard a couple of you in this room that I do fixed wireless access at the same time, in the same capacity that I have in the baseband.\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo how do I cost-justify that when I think about fixed wireless broadband? Am I saying that the cost of the shared infrastructure should be allocated to something other than fixed wireless broadband and fixed wireless broadband is just another piece? Or is it that I allocate it to the different products in a...\\nHans Vestberg\\nYes. Ultimately, you’re going to have different products going on for all technology rather than the technology being one solution. So you need to calculate that -- you have different products and you have use case where you can multiuse the capacity. And remember, all the passive equipment, you can multiuse the capacity in front of you. Yes, you need a little bit more capacity, but that is what I’m mentioning and a smaller piece of the total investment.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd so again, that 30 million homes, roughly 30% of the country or something like that, what are the characteristics? Is it density, that higher density makes it more attractive? Or is it that it’s not already overbuilt with fiber, which would make it less attractive? Is it the availability of a telephone pole in that census block?\\n\\nHans Vestberg\\nIt was based on what we saw as possibility with our plans to deploy 5G technology. And that together with where do you have the households, where does it makes sense to have an offering and all of that. That was woven into that whole calculation. Of course, our business team were doing the work on it. And of course, we were still early on to understand the technology. We know the technology better and better every day, so – but still that holds.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd you’re getting more bullish. So you’ve talked about 1,900...\\nHans Vestberg\\nAm I getting more bullish?\\nCraig Moffett\\nWell, no. I mean, over the last six months, Verizon has become even more bullish, based on your public comments, about how much of the country you can serve and how well the technology can perform. So you’ve talked about 1,900 to 2,000-foot radii for millimeter wave cell sites in fixed wireless broadband. It’s safe to say that is much more aggressive though than most of your peers. Not just peers here in the U.S. but even globally are struggling to find that same radius. Can you talk about that. What is it that you figured out that makes it possible to get these frequencies to work over those distances?\\nHans Vestberg\\nI think there’s few companies in the world that has done so extensive trials that Verizon has done. So I think that’s one of the keys. I mean, we have had 11 trial markets up for one year, one and half years trialing the equipment, the spectrum. And again, we are learning every day. And then it’s a combination of the antenna, the beams, the reflections and all of that. You learn all the time. I would say that some of the Koreans, they find the same type of distance that we are seeing. So I think that it’s more about how deep you are into the technology. And again, I can understand that others don’t see it because they’re not into the -- they might not even have it. So for us, this is a key technology and a key spectrum we’ve spent time on. We have people work on it every day. We work with all our key partners. And even when I came into Verizon 1 year ago, the whole market was basically saying, I wonder if millimeter wave is going to work. Now all carriers want to deploy millimeter wave. We have equipment coming out on 28 gigahertz for us this year. It’s going to come to 39 gigahertz next year as well. So it’s mind-boggling how quickly it has changed what we can do with it.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd you’re fully confident that these spectrum bands, 28, 24, 37, 39, cannot just be line of sight...\\nHans Vestberg\\nYes, yes. With reflection and so on, yes.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd that’s true even in dealing with obstructions like trees and -- in some suburban areas?\\nHans Vestberg\\nYes. That’s working. And again, it’s all about also that you need the whole ecosystem, all the way from the antenna and the baseband through the receiver and how you bring it indoor. All that means to be well defined and all of that. So of course, you optimize all the time, and we are working on that. We are in the middle of our deployment right now, commercial deployment for our launch this year that we’re going to do in three to five cities.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd you’ve started in Sacramento.\\nHans Vestberg\\nSacramento is the only one we have launched officially.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd can you share any early learnings from Sacramento yet?\\nHans Vestberg\\nI can talk about all the markets we are launching in, but we are not telling you which they are. But no, we have commercial base stations up there right now. And we’re going for the ones in the second half, where you’re putting them in, we are densifying, we are checking that everything works before we’re launching. So, so far, the time plan is working.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd can you share anything more about the time frame that we should start to see...\\n\\nHans Vestberg\\nSecond half of 2018 is a good time line.\\nCraig Moffett\\nJust for those five?\\nHans Vestberg\\nYes. But remember also that you said five. I said three to five.\\nCraig Moffett\\nLet’s say four.\\nHans Vestberg\\nYes. So that’s sort of built on our proprietary software that we built together with the Koreans. As soon as the NR, which is the standard 5G, is coming out, we’re also deploying that. And again, you need to remember what I said in the beginning or in the middle here. The basebands will have 5G NR will be mobility as well as fixed wireless access. And we are preparing the network. As soon as the NR technology is coming out, we also will have that in the network in order to have 5G mobility at the same time. So sometimes, you get the feeling that we’re only doing fixed wireless access. The reason we are doing that in the beginning, we have the proprietary solution for that. As soon as NR is coming, which we are pushing everyone in ecosystem, we will be ready for that as well. You need some handsets and whatever devices you’re going to have. That’s important as well. The network is always ahead of the devices, remember that, so you can always enable the network ahead of the devices. And that’s what we’re doing.\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo the $64,000 question or I guess the 18...\\nHans Vestberg\\n$64,000?\\nCraig Moffett\\n$18 billion question...\\nHans Vestberg\\n17 to 17 point...\\nCraig Moffett\\nCapEx. Talk to us about five, doing three to five cities, sorry, three to five cities is obviously something that does not radically change the capital spending of Verizon. But a massive deployment into hundreds of cities sounds like an awfully expensive proposition to investors. Can you talk about how you do this within the capital budget or how we should think about the capital budget for this kind of future network?\\nHans Vestberg\\nSo I made a guidance for this year, 17 billion to 17.8 billion. So I’m not here to change that one. Matt Ellis is managing that for this time. I think that, remember again, the majority of what we are deploying is common network right now. We’re going to the Intelligent Edge Network. I told the market there were two reasons for it. One, in order to give new 5G services, I need the whole streamlining of the network to do it. Secondly, it was to take down costs. Because I don’t need the four different transport solutions. I don’t need four different ways of doing [Indiscernible] I need one and I need fiber for all of it. And that’s what we have been doing for quite a while. So then you come to ask me, Okay, so will 5G be more expensive? Much of the equipment already is prepared. Certain types of -- big amount of our radio base stations are software upgradable to 5G. So it’s totally different than when we went from 3G to 4G, where, basically, hey, this 3G base station doesn’t really work now that we’re going to 4G because CDMA to LTE was not really super compatible. So...\\nCraig Moffett \\nBut still bringing -- you described the public works aspect of fiber deployment as the most expensive part, not the fiber itself. So bringing that public works project to every street, avenue and cul de sac in America and bringing dense fiber, more cell sites for shared-use infrastructure or for small, medium business and residential and fixed wireless broadband, whatever the use case is, it’s still a lot of money, right? I mean, it’s hard to see doing that within the existing envelope of the capital budget, isn’t it?\\nHans Vestberg \\nNo. I think that, first of all, we have been doing that for quite a while. So that’s already in what we’re doing today. I mean, I think that’s -- you need to think that we’re doing -- remember, we’re doing, for example, fiber, we would have multi tenants over -- for the fiber. And of course, we’re always looking to, hey, can we buy fiber from someone that is actually doing the sort of typology wrong? Can we rent it? Or should we do it ourselves, as anyone would do? We have come to the conclusion, in certain areas, that we do it ourselves, and last year, we announced our collaboration with Corning with 12.5 million lines -- miles of fiber secured for doing it. So of course, we are doing more now a days by ourselves, but that’s because the economics is better than doing it from somebody else. So that should be good news. \\n\\nSo now we will continue to work extremely efficient with our capital allocation. I take it as a huge responsibility for me and my engineering team, use the latest tools, the best technologies, best vendors in order to get the most out of our capital, and that’s what we are doing. And I got the questions already early this year, should you spend more if you have tax money and all of that. Remember, you don’t want to have spikes in your CapEx because this is something that is very prudent when you do allocation and you don’t -- you want to plan it in the right way. And I think -- and I have nothing to do with it, but the Verizon team, they are good at it.\\nCraig Moffett \\nI have two last topics I want to talk about. I want to start with the cable operators. And I want to talk about Sprint and T-Mobile.\\nHans Vestberg \\nSprint and T-Mobile as well. I am Verizon, remember that.\\nCraig Moffett \\nLet’s start with the cable operators. The cable operators, I guess, are increasingly sort of becoming frenemies to you. You obviously compete with them on access, but they’re positioned to become some of your largest customers. How do you think about -- and they also have infrastructure that they could presumably be suppliers to you for some backhaul capability. So how do you think about the cable operators. Do you view them as competitors, frenemies, customers, suppliers?\\nHans Vestberg \\nI think that’s the word you’re going with. With the technology implosion, you end up as frenemies. I think that the cable operators here are good customers of us. We have good working relationship on the wireless side. Of course, in certain areas where we are doing sort of cable services, they are doing as well, you are competing. So I think that’s how you need to live. I mean, you need to be able to partner in the right ways and in the right moments. I mean, it’s nothing strange.\\nCraig Moffett\\nDoes their infrastructure fit with your vision? There was a lot of talk a year or so ago that cable dense wired infrastructure would be a big advantage as a supplier or even in a merger with a telecom company. And that has, to some extent, evolved party because of Lowell’s comment about 1,700 strands and his preferred architecture. How do you think about it? Is that -- how valuable is that infrastructure for what you’re doing?\\nHans Vestberg\\nFirst of all, I mean, I think that what -- if you’re a wireless operator, your fiber needs to be in a certain way. I mean, Point to point might not be the right way. You want rings of fiber. So of course, you need to know what they have. I don’t know what they have. But I guess, few have built it like that because they aren’t building it as wireless carriers.\\nCraig Moffett\\nOkay. Let’s talk quickly about Sprint and T-Mobile. There are...\\nHans Vestberg\\nThat would be very quick.\\nCraig Moffett\\nWell, their argument is that it’s not going to be possible for either of them individually to make the requisite investments in 5G unless they’re allowed to merge. Do you have some sympathy for that argument? And has Verizon taken a view on the merger?\\nHans Vestberg\\nI have no comment to that.\\nCraig Moffett\\nNo comment.\\nHans Vestberg\\nNo. We work with the right -- there’s a lot of things happening in the market. So for us to have an opinion about that -- we let the ones being in those merger discussions have an opinion. We need to execute on Intelligent Edge Network, doing the best 5G for mobility fixed wireless access and whatever, how many use cases we have, that’s my work and my team’s work. We’re hammering it every day, and we’ll just continue.\\nCraig Moffett\\nWhich is to say you’re going to duck the question for the next 12 months?\\nHans Vestberg\\nYes, definitely.\\nCraig Moffett\\nOkay.\\nHans Vestberg\\nI mean he’s honest ...\\nCraig Moffett\\nYes, that’s right. Well, they’re going to be next in this room.\\n\\nHans Vestberg\\nYes. So they’re going to answer. So there’s going to be [indiscernible].\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo I want to wrap up with a big-picture strategy question. At the end of the day, I know what you’re going to say here, but...\\nHans Vestberg\\nSo why do you ask?\\nCraig Moffett\\nIs real network advantage still possible, especially in wireless? Is it still possible to really differentiate a network in wireless? And then, more pointedly, can Verizon really maintain a sufficiently large differentiation on network advantage that it matters to customers?\\nHans Vestberg\\nYes, I think so. I think also that as the wireless technologies broaden out to more customer segments, not only consumers but industries and societies, it will be even more important that the performance of the network will be a key differentiator because in certain of the characteristics also of 5G with low latency or enormous throughput that can only be done from building a network in a certain way. That doesn’t mean that all carriers will build the same because it depends on what customer groups you have and what revenues you are looking for. And we are looking into a big part of the customer segment because we’re all in there and we think that this transformation will create new possibilities for us when it comes to 5G. So yes, I believe that performance matters.\\nCraig Moffett\\nWell, it’s -- you had a lot of promises as a company over the last year about the financials, ARPU and that sort of thing recovering. And it’s funny, when I was putting together my state of the industry slides for tomorrow, it’s very clear that you’re delivering on the things that you said you would deliver on. All of that starts with the network.\\nAnd so with that in mind, I want to thank you for kicking off this conference with a really in-depth session about Verizon’s network because I think it’s fascinating to me. And I think, at the end of the day, you can’t avoid the engineering questions if you’re really going to understand this business.\\nHans Vestberg \\nAbsolutely.\\nCraig Moffett \\nSo this has been enormously helpful to everyone here. And I thank you for joining us.\\nHans Vestberg\\nThank you.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nEnd of Q&A', '/article/4154212-verizon-communications-vz-management-presents-deutsche-bank-media-telecom-and-business': 'Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Deutsche Bank Media, Telecom & Business Services Conference March  7, 2018  8:00 AM ET\\nExecutives\\nRonan Dunne - Executive Vice President and Group President, Verizon Wireless\\nAnalysts\\nMatthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank AG\\nOperator\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nQ - Matthew Niknam\\nOkay. If everybody can, please, go ahead and take their seats. Welcome, everyone, to day three Deutsche Bank Media Telecom and Business Services Conference. I\\'m Matt Niknam, telecom services analyst here at Deutsche Bank. We are very pleased to welcome EVP and Group President of Verizon wireless, Ronan Dunne. Ronan, welcome.\\nMy pleasure, thank you.\\nThank you very much, great to be here.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nSo maybe just to get started, I think Ronan, it\\'s been about 1.5 years, I believe, since you joined Verizon, 17 years at O2 in Europe. Can you give us your high-level view of the U.S. wireless market and maybe some of the bigger - biggest surprises for you since joining the company?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSure, but let me just start by - let\\'s pop up our safe harbor statement there and just guide you guys. So the first thing I noticed is that you guys spelled harbor wrong, but apart from that - and I discovered that driving on the wrong side of the road is driving on the right side of the road. So that\\'s two observations.\\nI think the thing that\\'s interesting for me, there\\'s a couple of very distinct things about the market here and the market in Europe. The first is that those of you following Europe will know is there is more than 100 regulated carriers in Europe in a footprint that\\'s not materially different from the U.S., so it\\'s a highly fragmented market, national market, national regulation despite the European umbrella.\\nSo the smallest carrier in the U.S. is about twice the size of the largest domestic carrier in Europe. That\\'s one big factor. And I think scale is an increasingly important consideration in our industry.\\nThe second thing is that Europe is predominantly single-user plan, so individuals buy their wireless plan as opposed to the family plan or the multi-line plan, which is the core offering inside the U.S. market. And I think and we\\'ll note that -- touch on it in due course.\\nWhat\\'s interesting about that is that as you move into a converged or into an opportunity inside the home, whether that be residential, broadband or otherwise, wireless carriers like ourselves in the U.S. have stronger relationships with the household budget holder because of that family plan structure than a carrier in Europe, where it tends to be the wireline carriers are more effective selling through wireless and wireless carriers selling through wireline because many of the wireless carriers don\\'t have that relationship with the household budget holder. So I think scale, I think the single line versus the multi-line are probably the two biggest things apart from spelling.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nOkay. Yes, I\\'ve been on the wrong side of the road in London as well, so. Maybe to sort of drill it down, as you think about what\\'s a - maybe a more conducive economic backdrop in the U.S. for wireless, what are the some of the top priorities, I guess, specifically for Verizon wireless this year 2018?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo look. Again, I think -- we\\'ll talk about 5G and other things, but -- sort of, my priorities are really, really clear. It\\'s to continue to execute on the fundamentals. We\\'re not waiting for anything.\\nThere are some fantastic opportunities out there, so consistently executing against those, and that\\'s about attracting and retaining the best-value customers in the market. We have world-class churn, but we can always do better, and we will focus on that.\\nI think the other thing is that from a market point of view that we\\'re very focused on is the return to service revenue growth. And we\\'ve said very clearly that we are on a clear path to the half, of midyear.\\n\\nObviously, there\\'s the accounting revenue recognition adjustments, but on a like-for-like basis, by midyear and showing good trends, we were just inside 3% in the fourth -- minus 3% in the fourth quarter last year and a good trajectory. So that, again, is really important.\\nAnd I think the other thing is that in doing both of those things is I have the opportunity to position Verizon to be better positioned than anyone else for the emerging opportunity that is 5G.\\nSo don\\'t wait, execute now, drive service revenue growth, but at the same time, prepare yourselves to be able to exploit the opportunity of 5G just as soon as it comes.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nIt\\'s a good segue to my next question. So your peers -- I mean, it is obviously only 4 nationals here relative to what you\\'re used to abroad, but each have been actively investing in network, content ownership and/or bundling. It\\'s a maturing market.\\nHow does Verizon wireless differentiate, stay ahead of the curve? And maybe you can talk to some of the competitive advantages that set Verizon apart.\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo the first thing that I think anyone from Verizon would start with is network. Network is a compelling component of any proposition than anybody offers and our long-term and enduring commitment to best-in-class network is fundamental and foundational to us.\\nAnd if you think about network, sometimes people don\\'t really think of it this way, but I see network as an enabling platform. It\\'s a layer that is capable of serving right across the market, so whether that be Verizon-branded business, whether that be our relationship with the MSOs, with people like TracFone.\\nThat is an enabling layer. It\\'s a scale asset and, therefore, optimizing the yield on return on that scale, critically important. So that\\'s the first piece of the equation. And we\\'re better positioned than anyone else in the market on that, both quality, coverage capacity.\\nThe second thing is then to build on top of that fundamental connectivity layer, and that\\'s to ensure that we\\'re delivering experiences for consumers and solutions for business that really embed the connectivity layer but create the value add on top. And we can do that in a number of ways.\\nWe can do that with our products and services layer so B2B with OneTalk, with security products in the public sector with creating prioritization, creating a dedicated core for public safety. So enhancing the service capability and the offering there to really embed added value in that layer, and then sitting on top of it, in consumer products like hum and other things, which then sit on top of that later.\\nSo that way, we have a yield play on a national asset that is highly efficient. We are the lowest-cost producer in our industry. And then we have the value add layer on top.\\nAnd I think as we play into the 5G market, what will increasingly be the case is the value that\\'s created on top of a compelling connectivity layer is really exciting, and I think, because of the way we feel of our 4G network, we will both be fast to and super efficient to accelerating that opportunity into 5G.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nYou\\'ve got a network, obviously, that\\'s sort of the broader platform, but do you feel like you\\'ve got the assets in place to compete effectively and maintain market leadership and maybe conversely and more -- the question I\\'m getting at is, are there strategic assets you don\\'t have today that would help strengthen your positioning particularly in a 5G world?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo good question, and I think within that, there\\'s things like content and various other things that are subcomponents of it. So let me kind of take it in its layers. The first thing that 5G is going to allow us to do is to provide ubiquitous connectivity.\\nIt\\'s going to allow us to participate up and down the connectivity stack, whether that be the residential, broadband, whether it be B2B or our traditional mobility play. That in itself creates new addressable markets, is interesting. The context of that then says in that broader sense, where does content play a role?\\n\\nAnd I think there, what we\\'re seeing is we\\'re seeing the evolution of various trends, and you guys are probably better-placed than me to make the bets on linear and content ownership versus -- but what is clear is content ownership is fragmenting and the way people engage with content is fragmenting and the way people engage with content is fragmenting with the combination of over-the-top and traditional linear.\\nI think the role that a carrier can play is really about how do we curate, how do we aggregate. That doesn\\'t mean we won\\'t be principal in certain elements of content. Probably, our sports rights asset is a good example of that, leveraging those across the portfolio both within the Oath business and inside the wireless business.\\nSo I don\\'t think it\\'s a one-size-fits-all. Is content an important consideration? Yes, it is. But I\\'m seeing the traffic on my network. I\\'m seeing our competitive position where an awful lot of content is being consumed on our network, but I\\'m not bundling any content at the moment, but I\\'m not disadvantaged by not bundling.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nAnd aside from content, maybe from a more hard asset mix, whether it\\'s spectrum or fiber?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo look, I think we\\'re very well positioned there. I know it\\'s always a question at these sort of events, but if you think about it in 3 buckets, so spectrum, we\\'re using about 50% of our existing spectrum assets for LTE at the moment, yet it\\'s carrying the vast, vast majority of our data and more than 50% of our voice. So more to go there.\\nThe 2 other things that we\\'re doing, and this is a consistent play, is they\\'re backed up with fiber and our commitments to roll out significant fiber with our One Fiber strategy and our commitments with Corning and others.\\nWe are enhancing the backbone for the wireless network and, therefore, getting fiber to the cell and the fiber to the node, and that enhances the capacity of the network. We\\'re densifying at the same time, so that the nature of the network is strong spectrum assets, only using about 50% for 4G LTE at the moment, increasing densification, which is optimizing the way we deliver that capacity in the network and it\\'s the classic build-versus-buy.\\nAnd then sitting on top of that is enhanced features that are coming all the time as we upgrade the old Alcatel-Lucent and then Nokia properties within our portfolio and increasing the capability of the network equipment.\\nBut then, on top of that, in the handsets, whether it\\'s the 256-QAM, 4x4 MIMO, all of these things are giving us incremental every time. So we see ourselves as very well positioned. You then layer on top absolutely stunning position in millimeter wave with the bandwidth that we have, up to 1 gig bandwidth in the millimeter wave and the 28 and the 39.\\nI think we\\'re very well positioned. I think from an industry point of view, the U.S. still has to sort out the mid-band tier, which is a broad piece, whether that be the CBRS and other things. And what you see in other markets is that 3.5 is becoming a kind of a norm for the mid-band.\\nSo I think we\\'re very well positioned. I think we have a good slew of assets, but the way we built our 4G network and the strategy means that we have a much more natural segue to the investment case in 5G than, I think, some of our competitors.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nOkay, we will get into that in more detail, but maybe to start, let\\'s sort of go to the existing LTE business. It\\'s been 1 year since you introduced unlimited at a time when many would say the state of competition in U.S. wireless was really accelerating, but things seemed a bit more subdued this year, at least from the analyst point of view. Can you comment on the latest you\\'re seeing thus far? And how competitive intensity has changed and evolved over last year?\\n\\nRonan Dunne\\nSure. So I think all of you will recognize that kind of the fall in the holiday season in -- at the end of 2016 was a highly intense competitive environment. And some of you maybe have heard Matt Ellis, our CFO, used this anecdote, which I think he stole off me, so I\\'ll tell it briefly is, this idea that we were showing up in the market selling bananas on our cart, and the other guy is showing up, selling oranges on their cart. And the customers were saying, I know your bananas are the best bananas in the market, but what\\'s the exchange rate between bananas in your cart and oranges on their cart? I.e., a metered plan versus unlimited. So we try to solve the problem by -- everybody gave the customer a free apple. That\\'s the way we did it. So we said, don\\'t worry about the plan, here\\'s a free apple.\\nWhat we did is we changed the equation. We said look, we\\'ll put oranges on our cart. Now you\\'ve got the best quality oranges on the cart. Customers immediately recognized it and said, I understand now that I\\'ve got a like-for-like offering, except that Verizon does it better so I get unlimited on the best network.\\nAnd that moved the model from a competition point of view and moved the, what I would describe as the, distraction of \"it\\'s all about the device.\" We\\'re in the business of selling our services and how those enhance solutions for business and experience for consumers. So I think that step-change of us participating in that unlimited market changed the context of competition.\\nThe second trend that I think is important is the relationship between the upgrade cycle, device replacements and churn has changed fundamentally as people\\'s holds time on their device has extended. So this idea that, with probably all your models, 2 or 3 years ago was you got a 24 months spike, you re-buy the customers loyalty at the moment, that they get a subsidized device on an upgrade.\\nThat\\'s not the way the market works anymore. So people are separating their decision from this moment of replacement because they\\'re extending the replacement cycle. And that is, again, changing the nature of competition in the sense of all focused on device.\\nAnd that same trend is also one of the reasons why we see more opportunity potentially for growth because what\\'s happening is people, instead of replacing their handset every 23 or 24 months, or saying, well, maybe I\\'ll add a wearable, or, I\\'ll add a connected device, like a tablet where the first generation were -- tended to be Wi-Fi only and now they\\'re cellular and Wi-Fi.\\nSo I think the shape of the market has changed, and as a result, which I think is good for consumers, people are focusing on the services and the experience they\\'re delivering, rather than focusing on just accounting other people\\'s hardware.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nAny updates you can share just in terms of the quarter itself and how you\\'ve been performing?\\nRonan Dunne\\nBrady would shoot me if I give you updates on the quarter. So look, I think the thing I would say is that we\\'re seeing the sort of behaviors that we would expect. The first quarter tends to be a lower-activity quarter, overall. It tends to be a little bit of swapping out of people who got stuffed during the holidays in the fourth quarter and a little bit of swapping out of that in Q1.\\nThere doesn\\'t tend to be any significant device launches. So we\\'ll have the S9, obviously, towards the back end of March, but it\\'s generally a quiet quarter and then the momentum tends to build across. So very much business as usual.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nGot it. Okay, okay. One last one just on post-paid phone, specifically just around cable MVNOs. That\\'s, I think, a big sort of threat that\\'s looming. You maybe have a little bit of a side benefit being the sort of wholesaler to cable, but how do you sort of assess the threat there?\\n\\nAnd think about, in the context of Verizon having returned to volume growth last year and now you\\'ve got a big headwind that will pick up with additional launches, how do you sort of assess that threat in \\'18?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo look, I would -- I kind of break it into 2 parts. Without underplaying the role that the MSOs can play, it\\'s a highly competitive marketplace already. It\\'s not like somebody just showed up and said, \"Hey, let\\'s make wireless competitive.\" So we compete every single day, and that\\'s a good thing. So I don\\'t think it fundamentally changes the game.\\nThe second thing I would say is that the nature of the way the MSOs are coming to market is they\\'re looking to complement and, I would say, reinforce their core businesses, rather than, essentially, an assault on the wireless business. This is more about their business and their relationship with customers and enhancing. And I\\'ve seen that in markets across Europe.\\nAnd as you rightly say, the third component for us is that we have the participation through the wholesale arrangement that says we\\'re also participating. And I think it matters, as said as well publicly, is we\\'re not giving up our fair share to the MSOs, and therefore, we\\'re getting the benefit of 100 customers coming in and giving less than our fair share out. So from a net-net point of view, that\\'s a good position to be in.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nYou touched on service revenue growth and an improving trajectory in 2018. So the industry moved to unlimited. Obviously, Verizon sort of went there as well early last year. Most of the industry, I would say, are kind of leading with these kinds of offers. So in that context, how does Verizon monetize incremental data usage and traffic growth on wireless networks?\\nRonan Dunne\\nOkay. So I think there\\'s really 3 or 4 layers to this. So the first thing is -- and there\\'s 2 sides to this model. I\\'ll come back to revenue in a second, but one important thing to understand is the nature of the growth in traffic since we went unlimited is different from what we\\'ve seen previously.\\nSo we broadened out the time shoulders of when the network is busy, and we broaden out the geos in which the network is busy. So from a yield point of view, this is giving us an even better yield on the network and on the network investment because we\\'re selling more of the spare capacity that we had in the network. That\\'s the first and important thing to say.\\nThen if I look at the revenue side, I would give you, really, 3 trends. And I touched a little bit on one of them earlier. So we\\'re still acquiring new customers and new accounts.\\nSo account growth is important, but what we\\'re seeing is the participation in those accounts is growing so people are adding either more lines, more wearables, more connected devices. And I think there\\'s plenty of opportunity there. The average household is significantly increasing the number of connected devices.\\nAnd I think the third piece is that, that same investment is supporting a substantial component of the investment case for addressing the residential broadband market. So those are 3 elements of how we continue to see monetization from essentially an unlimited environment.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nMaybe it\\'s a good segue into the 5G discussion. So very top-of-mind, we just came off Mobile World Congress a week ago. You\\'ve mentioned planning launches in 3 to 5 markets later this year. Can you help us think about how 5G tangibly changes the addressable market and revenue opportunity?\\nWe know about fixed wireless, but bigger picture, we hear so many use cases. Can you maybe help us think a little bit more tangibly about how this changes your opportunity at Verizon?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo again, if I start on the cost side, my cost of delivering incremental capacity, which is in a 5G world, it\\'s the most efficient bearer that we\\'ve had ever. So that\\'s important. So if you were -- if the backdrop is that there\\'s continued demand coming for our service, which I think is a really positive from an investment-case point of view, is the more efficiently we can deliver that, the better.\\n\\nSo just on a like-for-like basis, I would, given how I built my 4G network, the fact that I have fiber to the node and fiber to the cell is I would deploy 5G anyway to give me incremental capacity and reduce my overall cost of production, that\\'s the first piece.\\nThen I think in B2B, and we\\'re early in some of the standards development, needs to deliver additional elements before all of these cases. But a lot of the space that we were seeing is kind of nascent to some of the IoT space, the telematics space, some of the edge computing type capabilities that people have been talking about. 5G starts to bring those from being, very often, niche case to, potentially, mass deployment. And one example which we\\'ve touched on in conversation before is an idea of smart cities.\\nSmart cities is something that\\'s been talked about for a long time, but the cost of deployment has maybe been -- but one of the examples where the edge compute capability on the smarts in the network, if you think about surveillance in the big city and the idea that a really effective surveillance would have a facial recognition and other things in the cameras, they may cost $5,000 a piece to deploy.\\nIf we\\'re able to take that and put it in the edge and do that compute there, the ability to say, actually, there may be $100 cameras, and I can deploy 5 or 10,000 of them and deliver the same experience, that changes the economics for deployment.\\nAnd I think in a number of examples, what you will see is the end cost to deliver at scale, which may be device-based or deployment-based will be changed by this ability to change the balance of what\\'s done in the network versus what\\'s done at the endpoint.\\nAnd I think if you take that as a concept and deploy it, you can then start to see a ton of use cases where the existing model is interesting but not necessarily scalable and suddenly it becomes.\\nThe other is latency, and again, the idea that you\\'re going from hundreds milliseconds to low double-digit milliseconds of latency, again, starts to say is deploying of services where you were previously constrained by where you could get fiber or wireline, you can now deploy. Or even where it\\'s a like-for-like substitution, you create more flexibility in the deployment by doing it wirelessly.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nIf we take -- step one, I guess, has been fixed wireless, which we talked about. Can you maybe give us any update on how you\\'re tracking towards this target of 3 to 5? I know we\\'ve heard Sacramento, but how are you tracking towards the other boorish markets, I\\'d say? And any color you can share on the go-to-market strategy?\\nRonan Dunne\\nWell, I won\\'t share any color on go-to-market strategy, otherwise, I think other people will be scribbling and passing my notes to people. But what I would say to you is I have no intention of simply turning up. This is about creating a new experience for customers, otherwise, why bother?\\nSo the opportunity is really to understand how the deployment of this technology allows us to do things differently. We went out, and we did a lot of work, the biggest trial in the marketplace anywhere in the world, to understand the use cases, to understand the realities in deployment, to understand how we best set up the network to deliver the experience but then also to focus on how we deliver great experiences in the home. And what I would say is that it\\'s a fascinating place, transformational.\\nWe have the opportunity from a market in which you hid your CPU to an environment where people want to put their Apple and Google and other devices in the middle and admire them. We\\'re transforming the home environment at the moment and it\\'s a great opportunity for a residential broadband truly wireless offering to be part of how you create that transformational experience.\\n\\nSo we\\'re very focused on, not just showing up and saying, \"Hey, we do gigabit broadband speeds as well,\" to offering something that is part of transforming the experiential inside the home and whether that be security, whether it be content consumption, whether it be that interface with voice, whether it be other elements. There are lots of opportunities.\\nSo it will take time, the 3 to 5 markets we said is that\\'s really going to the initial commercial launch, getting out there, getting it in front of the customer, getting not just the technical use cases but the real experiential and then driving through as we go to 5G in our, in 2019, and we\\'ll be driving that hard.\\nSo I\\'m -- look, I\\'m excited about it because it\\'s a great opportunity to take what Verizon does well, which is deliver great network experience and apply to it. What is my ambition is to turn connectivity into possibilities for everyone and everything and get people excited about the experiences it delivers.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nWhat\\'s the time line to get to the -- you talked about 30 million homes over time. Any sense of time line in terms of how you expect to ramp there? And then maybe a question you may be able to better answer is the criteria you used to select these markets, anything special about?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYes, that\\'s a great question because I made the point earlier about the way we look at how we deploy the network and how having done it facilitates the rollout of 5G. So there\\'s a top down, and there\\'s a bottom up. The first thing we do is we start with the customer, oddly, rather than with the network assets.\\nStart with the customer. We look at the addressable market, both mobility and residential broadband in the market. We look at what the competitive set is. We look at the availability of other technologies. We look at our market share. We look at others. So we do our proper market assessment and there, we say, okay, there\\'s an exciting market.\\nThen we look at the network, and we look at what we\\'ve got there. We look at the topography. We look at the mix between single-occupancy dwellings and MVUs and then we look at the network efficiency and then, by putting those 2 pieces together, you get that sweet spot of oh, it\\'s a fantastic market opportunity. And the great news is the guys have built the network such as we\\'re almost there already. So those, oddly enough, will be top of the list.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nOkay. Maybe let\\'s shift to 5G mobility. This is another interesting topic, one of your peers has actually talked about launching mobile 5G in a dozen markets later this year -- launching, I didn\\'t say offering service with handsets.\\nOthers have talked about nationwide mobile launches in 2019. At Verizon, how do you think about the time line for mobile 5G rollouts? And are there any structural reasons why your rollouts schedule may be different from some peers?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYes, good question. So kind of just linking to the answer to the previous question is, so this is an integrated network and market strategy. It\\'s not like I have a network 5G fixed wireless deployment, I have a network 5G mobility deployment and I have a marketing strategy. It\\'s one single integrated strategy. So that\\'s the approach that we\\'re taking and building.\\nSo we\\'re already assessing the markets that we\\'ll go to. We\\'re leading with 5G mobility and then we\\'re looking at the optimization of the 5G fixed wireless opportunity because the core investment case is the 5G mobility case, to be crystal clear, because it\\'s a low-cost bearer, it gives us massive incremental capacity, therefore, we would be deploying 5G mobility even if there wasn\\'t a single city in the U.S. that gave us the 5G fixed wireless. So it\\'s an incremental opportunity on top of a core business case that works.\\n\\nSo from a timing point of view, there\\'s no reason why our position will be different from others in the sense of we\\'re taking a different strategy. I think because of the assets we hold, there\\'s every reason to believe that we can be first. Substantial investment in fiber already, great assets in millimeter wave.\\nI think for 2018, the reality is the constraints will be the availability of NR radio. Whatever anyone tells you, that will be a real physical constraint. There may be well some devices out there, but there won\\'t be handsets in 2018. And certainly, having spoken to everyone from chipset manufacturers to device manufacturers at Mobile World Congress and I\\'m sure as soon as I finish my meeting, my competitors were in the next meeting and the next meeting.\\nSo I think it\\'s pretty clear is you might get some engineering samples of some things that might get into the market as POPs or other things at the back end. And then what you will see is you will see devices appear from the middle of 2019.\\nSo I think what we want to make sure that we do is, in our network deployment strategy is, be ready to access those markets just as ready as the -- just as quickly as the devices are available. And look, there would be noise at the back end of this year about the PR-ing and the whatever-elses.\\nTo be really, really clear, I\\'m not building a PR network. I\\'m building a network that\\'s worthy of Verizon. Every single customer out there knows the best-in-class services delivered by Verizon, and we will do exactly that in 5G like we have in 2G, 3G and 4G. That\\'s the one thing you can be absolutely certain about. Everything else could be fake news.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nOkay. I had to follow up on that. Millimeter wave is where -- that\\'s kind of been the baser foundation initially for 5G. How do you think about scalability though? And the reason I mentioned that is because I could almost assure you the two presenters following you have talked about more broad national rollouts, leveraging what used to be high-band but maybe is now more mid-band type spectrum.\\nSo if millimeter wave -- and I assume your holdings in your small cell deployments are probably more concentrated into larger urban metros. How do you then think about leveraging your current spectrum or maybe additional spectrum to take this more nationally?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSort of, I think the industry globally agrees that there is a complementarity to millimeter wave, which is brilliantly positioned for metro with a mid-band. And generally, the mid-band has now been described as 6 gig and below, so it\\'s a pretty broad swap. And there\\'s 2 key factors here.\\nSo yes, any carrier in the world says if there\\'s an opportunity to acquire spectrum, you always are interested in it. Why? Because you do the build-versus-buy equation and it\\'s a pretty well developed map, and that hasn\\'t really changed just because 5G arrived.\\nSo I think we\\'ll all be looking at -- so whether it be access to the unlicensed spectrum, whether it be enhancements to carrier aggregation, whether it be the acquisition of new spectrum or whether it be the redeployment of existing spectrum, there\\'s a number of opportunities.\\nBut I don\\'t think any of us, really at the end of day, disagree with it. A combination of the ultrahigh frequencies and the mid-band is the optimum balance of coverage capacity for national scale.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nOkay. What happens to LTE if 5G gets rolled out? I mean, I just -- I asked if there\\'s still CDMA that\\'s around as well, but I asked it in terms of maybe life cycle of your existing legacy networks. How do we sort of think about this phase out, potentially, of CDMA or of LTE as you sort of move more and more traffic onto 5G?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo this CDMA business case is simple. I can reduce the cost of my devices because of the chipset that\\'s in there, and I can enhance the voice experience that customers get with HD voice on my Voice over LTE network. So that\\'s a customer upgrade as much as it is a refarming our network.\\n\\nAnd again, sometimes in these conversations, we lose sight of what\\'s in it for the customer. So we\\'re focused on enhancing the customer experience. There is a massive opportunity to enhance the experience that customers have by putting more of them on 4G LTE devices that have the latest chipset in them, that have the latest capabilities like 256-QAM, et cetera, et cetera.\\nSo there\\'s an upgrade cycle for experience for customers already before you go to 5G. 5G will have 2 benefits. It will increment the use cases that are available. A lot of those will be B2B, but the thing to think about B2B is that they will ultimately, most of them, be B2B2C opportunities. So think about our market as less it\\'s B2B and it\\'s B2C.\\nThink about 5G as probably the enabler that starts to really deliver on this B2B2C proposition as more of our business customers\\' end use cases, which touch their customer are enhanced by 5G.\\nAnd I think the other thing to think about is on day 1, when you put 5G mobility in place, you lift traffic off the 4G network and you enhance therefore capacity and the offering that\\'s available in the 4G. So I don\\'t see them as one replace the other. I see them as complementary to each other and a better experience on both layers because you have the two.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nWhere are you - and just one last follow-up on that. CDMA, I mean, if you quantify to talk about how many users are still there and maybe an opportunity to begin decommissioning that.\\nRonan Dunne\\nNo, so what we have said is more than 50% of my voice traffic is on voice over LTE. And I think we have the highest percentage of pretty much of any carrier in world on that, so we\\'ve driven hard on that, and we continue to drive it. That still gives us the opportunity about the refarming of that CDMA spectrum and how many carriers we need as the amount of traffic on that. But CDMA was built as a great experience, so the transition will be one that\\'s driven by customer, rather than driven by any other technical requirement.\\nWhat we are keen to get customers on to, the best experience HD voice, the best devices to give them the best mobility experience, whether that be voice or data. So that is part of the strategy, but it\\'s customer-driven.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nMaybe a question that -- maybe a question for Hans, but I\\'m going to ask it to you as well. Tax reform. I mean there\\'s significant cash savings from tax reform. Does that change at all how you think about the timing of network investments in fiber rollouts? And I know you guys have been pretty clear around the \\'18 budget being set at $17 billion, but there are bigger bonus depreciation benefits that go beyond \\'18, so.\\nRonan Dunne\\nLook, my observation on that is it\\'s a significant impact, but the first question you\\'ve got to ask yourself is, in the conversation a month beforehand, was Verizon talking about being constrained in its either ambition or its investment? The answer is no, it wasn\\'t. So we had a very clearly articulated strategy. We made significant commitments to the rollout of fiber and other things.\\nSo we\\'ve been putting our money where our mouth is for quite some time and have never shied at investing against the opportunity to build out the network or do other things. So it\\'s not surprising that there wasn\\'t a whole series of unserved clear business cases and needs.\\nSo I don\\'t see it as a change to our strategy because I would question anybody whose strategy is fundamentally constrained by tax policy because we take playing the long game here. So I don\\'t see it as a fundamental change. Is it an enhancement to our cash flow capabilities or debt service capabilities or flexibility?\\nOf course, it is. But is it changing our fundamental philosophy which is to invest fast and first in building a superior network experience that\\'s the basis of giving an enhanced experience to customers? No, it hasn\\'t.\\n\\nMatthew Niknam\\nCost structure has been a big area of success at Verizon wireless, I would argue, particularly in the context of a top -- some of the service revenue pressure you\\'ve seen in recent years. As you look forward, where do you see the biggest opportunities for incremental cost savings in the business?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo this is $10 billion over 4 years. Yes. And so I think...\\nMatthew Niknam\\nAnd the bulk of it\\'s coming you for quite a while.\\nRonan Dunne\\nI think Hans and myself have probably signed up for a good proportion of that. What\\'s interesting there -- the first thing to say -- and those of you who follow Verizon will know this even before I arrived.\\nThe one thing that we have is an exemplary track record in business transformation and cost focus. That\\'s why we are the lowest-cost carrier in our marketplace. So the focus has always been there in Verizon.\\nWhat I think are the really interesting areas are the enhanced capabilities of the equipment we\\'re deploying in the network now. The optimization of that strategy means that, actually, we can get more for the same or more for less on the network side. So we\\'ve said that, while we\\'re not reducing our network investment, the bang for our buck that we\\'re getting means that we can save some money on deployment on the network side.\\nAnd I think the other area is in the area of delivering to the customer, so driving more of our traffic online to digital but also more of our service experience. So we\\'re investing in AI, machine learning, supporting enhanced customer service. We\\'re seeing more of our customers use our digital channels for service.\\nSo our focus is on enhancing the personalization and customization of the experience for our customers, which drives higher satisfaction but by automating it allows us to make it high quality replicable services at a lower cost to serve.\\nSo actually, you\\'ll see the migration from voice in the call centers and other things. That will be a significant driver where we\\'re driving the customer -- behind the customer behavior, and yet, it\\'s also a significant driver of efficiency within our business. So it\\'s a genuine win-win.\\nAnd I think with J.D. Power in the last month or so but for the first time, what they saw on their survey was consumers channel of choice is digital. That was the first time that they said to buy mobility services. Digital was their preferred channel.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nHave you talked about what percentage today in terms of Verizon wireless transactions are digital?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYes, so it kind of depends on how you define transactions, but in an environment where unlimited, people are coming less to check their balances and other things. If you\\'re talking about paying your bill, adding a line, changing your plan, whatever else, it\\'s almost half of those transactions are now digital transactions.\\nIf you look at pure purchase transactions or whatever, the benchmarks are still in Europe, where it\\'s kind of 20s or a little over 20%, mix. I think across the industry overall, our best estimate is about 10%, and we\\'re higher than that. That\\'s what I\\'d say.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nSo if we put this together, you talked earlier about service revenue trajectory inflecting positively. Obviously, the $10 billion, we\\'ll call it cash savings between OpEx and CapEx over 4 years.\\nHow should investors -- let\\'s focus on the OpEx part, how do investors think about the trajectory for wireless margins? And I mean, I bring this up in the context of newer competition, initial 5G launches, which may or may not serve as bigger headwinds this year.\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo I think what I would describe is you should expect a broadly stable environment there. We have the opportunity to continue to drive the top line growth. We will continue to be very, very focused on bottom line. But do I see significant shifts out of the kind of the norms? I don\\'t really.\\n\\nSo I think it\\'s -- I would describe it as a stable environment out there. And I think that, if we can be growing the top line in a stable margin environment, that sounds like good news to me.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nOkay. We talked a lot about 5G. Are there other growth opportunities for Verizon wireless that investors may not be considering or that we under appreciate?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo look, one of the things that I think -- again, my experience from Europe on this is, when I was running a carrier in the U.K., I set up a mobile advertising business called Weve [ph] then made it an industry model. It took 2 years to get that cleared in the EU and then bought it back about a year later from my competitors.\\nSo the area of information and deep analytics and enhancing the way we can deliver experienced to customers complemented by the size and scale of the data set that our partners in the Oath business have, I think it\\'s a really interesting opportunity.\\nYou\\'re talking about 1 billion eyeballs there around the genres of sports, entertainment, news and personal finance. But it\\'s such a big audience serving across those genres with a lot of brands.\\nI think this opportunity for carriers whether it be in 4G or 5G is to really -- are in by knowing and understanding our customers and by simple and easy to do business. We really earn their trust and end up being their partner to their digitally engaged lives by giving them more opportunities to leverage the information that we have about them to put them in a position to get the most out of their services, their relationship with brands and other things, I think that\\'s something that the Oath business is very focused on.\\nAnd I think our relationship with Oath is very complementary to that, but I also think we can be a benchmark inside the Oath portfolio for a best-in-class relationship, which also enhances their opportunity with carriers around the world.\\nAnd I think all of us, getting closer to our customers, curating those experiences, it\\'s the value on layer on top of connectivity that I think is the one that\\'s almost the underdeveloped one in our relationship with our customers. That\\'s what I\\'m really excited.\\nBecause if I give better personal experiences, allow customers to get closer to the brand that they choose and get those services and experiences, then you really are driving this B2B2C model where the consumer at the end of day is the one that benefits from taking the friction out in the system.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nIs that something that\\'s an \\'18 or near-term opportunity? Or you maybe need a little bit more integration, you could say, between Verizon Wireless and Oath?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo some of the things that we\\'re doing is the way we\\'re looking at, for example, sports writing content at the moment. So you would\\'ve seen at the opening of the NFL season, the fact they\\'re taking the game in London and putting it out there and getting on across the platform pretty much the same audience as you would\\'ve got for linear. So it\\'s evolving the experience.\\nAnd some of it is test and learn, but what you\\'ll see is you\\'ll see us come to the market differently over time. But yes, we\\'ll do things in 2018, but this is a play out over time.\\nI think, more broadly, even if we didn\\'t have Oath in our portfolio, I would be saying based on my experience in Europe, you need to get closer to your customers, you need to be more engaged with information. The fact that we have best-in-class assets in Oath means that we\\'ve been able to do that better and faster.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nOkay. Maybe if we tie this all together, we\\'re sitting here a year from now, what do you think we\\'ll look back on as key milestones for Verizon in 2018?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo I would probably put them into 3 things. In a very positive sense, I would like us to be saying we do what it says on the ten. So we have delivered by executing ruthlessly on the opportunity that\\'s there, on the fundamentals and really driving best-in-class performance in our 4G business, have positioned ourselves to be seen clearly as the ones who are going to deliver in a 5G world.\\n\\nAnd look, all these things take time, but the focus -- ruthless focus on the customer, this is about creating value above the connectivity layer by delivering the best-in-class connectivity. And I think we\\'re only scratching the surface of the opportunity.\\nSo the business that meets its customer needs better than anything else is the thing that I will spend every day focused on, and I think it\\'s the thing that ultimately makes the difference between price and value.\\nPrice is what you pay, value\\'s what you get every single day. This thing is the remote control for your life. People are focused on the value and utility they can get out of that. We need to be the indispensable partner to that ambition on behalf of our business and consumer customers. If we do, they\\'ll thank us with their loyalty.\\nMatthew Niknam\\nRonan, this is great.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\\nBrady Connor\\nThanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I’m here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lowell McAdam, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis.\\nAs a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.\\nBefore we get started, I like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon’s filings with the SEC, which are now available on our website.\\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell.\\nLowell McAdam\\nThank you Brady, and good morning everyone. I wanted to join today\\'s call to talk about 2017 results, the implications of tax reform to Verizon and then to talk about our strategic priorities for 2018.\\nLet me start off by recapping our impressive performance this year. I am proud of the focus and the execution from our team in 2017. We regained positive momentum in the marketplace and delivered strong operational and financial results. We launched\\nand expanded the most reliable unlimited experience for our customers, executed the world’s largest successful 5G pre-commercial trial, invested in assets and platforms for the future and gained significant traction in the integration of new businesses.\\nWe finished the year with great momentum in the fourth quarter as evidenced by our smartphone net additions and reoccurring levels of outstanding customer loyalty. In addition, the improvement in our wireless service revenue trajectory positions the business for growth moving forward.\\nThe integration of new businesses is accelerating our mobile-first digital strategy and providing a platform for global reach. In 2017 we made significant progress with our Oath assets as we build engaging brands around the key pillars of news, sports, finance and lifestyle and we leverage the Oath capabilities across all of our Verizon properties.\\nThe game changing content and technology partnerships that we recently announced with the NFL and NBA are great examples of how we are accelerating our digital right strategy with Yahoo sports and Verizon’s family of digital media brands. We are becoming the first screen for fans of live sports and superior partners for advertisers positioning us to show live-action in the engaging ways people want to consume video content.\\n\\nWe are investing for the future while maintaining a well-rounded approach to funding all aspects of our business. We enhanced our financial profile in 2017 with a number of transactions that strengthened the balance sheet that included lowering our borrowing cost, extending out our debt maturities and making a significant voluntary contribution to the pension fund.\\nNow let\\'s take a look forward. We ended the year with the president signing tax reform into law effectively restructuring the tax code for U.S. corporations. Verizon has long supported corporate tax reform that reduces rates to globally competitive levels and we are very pleased to see this legislation passed. The new tax law will have a positive impact to Verizon’s cash flow and earnings profile.\\nWe expect tax reform to enhance our cash flow from operations in 2018 by approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion. We have been disciplined in our approach to capital allocation since the inception of Verizon. We have always been focused on keeping our network the gold standard and investing in the business for growth while strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining strong dividend performance for our shareholders. This will continue to be the driving force behind the use of cash savings from tax reform.\\nAnd by strengthening the balance sheet it will give us the flexibility to execute our strategies going forward. Our employees drive the innovation and success of our business, so it is vital that we all share in the success of not only tax reform but the overall performance of Verizon. We will provide details on how we are investing in our employees later today, and will provide those details outside the company later today.\\nWe are good corporate citizens and share our success with the community. In 2017, Verizon and its foundation donated $75 million for disaster recovery and community projects. We will increase our contributions to the Verizon foundation by $200 million to $300 million over the next two years with the additional funds being dedicated to our efforts around human ability. And by human ability we mean applying our technology to making our customers lives better.\\nCombined these two initiatives will have an approximate $0.05 to $0.06 impact to our earnings per share for each of the next two years. As we head into 2018 our strategic priorities remain clear and are unchanged. The cornerstone of our strategy continues to be our best in class wireless network, which continues to be ranked number one in the nation in both voice and data network quality. Our unbroken run of JD Power and RootMetrics awards keeps getting longer.\\nIn our history, Verizon has always been in the forefront of technology innovation. We have led the transformation of the wireless industry from analog to today\\'s fourth generation LTE service. Now we have an unprecedented opportunity in front of us as we drive the evolution of the U.S. wireless industry to the fifth generation of mobile services.\\nNot too long ago people were saying 5G would not be possible until sometime between 2020 and 2022. Only one carrier has been consistent in its actions and messaging regarding 5G. Verizon has the spectrum bandwidth needed to provide the rich services of true 5G, our intelligent edge network capabilities and engineering know-how to lead the industry in providing the full suite of 5G gigabit services.\\nThe investment and pre-positioning of assets that we have accomplished will enable us to deliver the full range of 5G services including mobility, residential broadband, sub-millisecond latency applications, and other advanced consumer and IoT use cases. We have flexed our innovation muscle and are now taking 5G from a mere possibility to commercial reality by bringing 3 to 5 cities online this year with commercial services. The next industrial revolution will be on Verizon’s network and will positively impact society like no technology we have seen before. As we say around our offices, we don\\'t wait for the future. We build it, and we are doing it again with 5G.\\n\\nNow I will hand the call over to Matt to talk about the financial and operating details of the business starting with Slide 4.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, Lowell. It is great to be with you today and to share the results of our strong performance. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we reported earnings of $4.56 per share and full year earnings of $7.36 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss from special items of about $2.6 billion. This net loss consists of severance and mark-to-market adjustments for pension and OPEB liabilities of $1.2 billion, early debt redemption costs of $681 million, a charge for product realignment around early stage developmental technologies of $671 million, acquisition and integration related charges of $154 million pertaining mainly to Yahoo, and a non-cash pre-tax gain on spectrum license transactions of about $144 million.\\nAdditionally, as noted in our 8-K filing last week, the new tax law resulted in a one-time benefit of approximately $16.8 billion, or $4.10 per share. This benefit is primarily related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% corporate income tax rate. The cumulative net impact from these items after-tax was approximately $15.2 billion or $3.71 per share. Excluding the full effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 in the fourth quarter, which is flat compared to our performance in the same quarter a year ago.\\nFor the full year adjusted earnings per share was $3.74. Now let us move to a summary of the consolidated financial highlights of the quarter on Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, total operating revenue was $34 billion, an improvement of 5% and for the full year 2017 revenue was $126 billion. On a comparable basis, excluding divestures and new businesses, adjusted operating revenues declined approximately 2% for the year.\\nFor the full year, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items totaled approximately $45.1 billion and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.7%, slightly higher than last year\\'s margin of 35.5%.\\nLet us turn now to our wireless results on Slide 6. Our value proposition of providing unlimited service on the best network together with the simplicity of our offers is driving increased engagement from our valued customers. In the fourth quarter, total wireless operating revenue increased 1.7% to $23.8 billion, our first positive year-over-year growth in two years.\\nFor the full year, operating revenue totaled $87.5 billion, a decline of 1.9%. The sequential results in service revenue increased for the second consecutive quarter by 0.2% to $15.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, service revenues declined by 2.9%, a marked improvement over the same period last year.\\nThe improved trends to service revenues are attributed to several factors, including increased access revenues and new account formation. Our postpaid phone base migrations to un-subsidized service pricing are progressing and now represent approximately 80% of our postpaid phone base, approaching steady-state as most of our business customers remain on subsidized plans.\\nIn the fourth quarter, equipment revenue increased to $6.5 billion up 12.9% for the quarter and 7.8% for the full year. At the end of the quarter approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance. During the quarter we generated $9.5 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 9.6%. Wireless EBITDA margin was 39.8% compared to approximately 36.9% in the same period last year. As expected, the improvement in EBITDA was a function of better trends in service revenue and lower promotional activity than the prior year. For the full year, we generated $38.6 billion of EBITDA on total revenues of $87.5 billion.\\n\\nNow let us turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. In the fourth quarter, total smartphone net adds were 647,000 compared to 456,000 last year. Total postpaid net adds were 1.2 million, including phone adds of 431,000, 193,000 tablets and 550,000 other connected devices, predominantly wearables. For the third consecutive quarter we increased customer accounts adding 40,000 to our base.\\nFor the full year, postpaid net additions of 2.1 million included 774,000 phones, 31,000 tablets, and 1.3 million other connected devices. Our competitiveness in 2017 was highlighted by smartphone net adds of 1.8 million, up 34% versus the prior year. The overall experience of pairing our unlimited plan with the best network continues to resonate with our customer base, resulting in outstanding retail postpaid churn of 1.00%, and phone churn of 0.77% in the fourth quarter.\\nOn a year-over-year basis, postpaid churn improved by 10 basis points driven primarily by strong phone results. In the quarter, postpaid device activations totaled 12.4 million down from 13.1 million last year. About 82% of these activations were phones with wearables accounting for the majority of the other device activations.\\nOur retail postpaid upgrade rate was 7.2%, up sequentially as expected but was lower compared to the prior year. We are seeing an elongation of the upgrade cycle as more customers hold onto their devices for a longer period. During the quarter, 8.1 million phones were activated on device payment plans.\\nPre-paid net additions declined by 184,000 compared to a decline of 9,000 in the prior year. Our smartphone prepaid base increased during the quarter. All of the decline in prepaid net additions was due to basic prepaid phones as we have deliberately reduced our focus in that area. We ended 2017 with 116 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 1.9% to 111 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million for the year.\\nLet us move next to our wireline segment on Slide 8. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment increased 0.1% in the quarter and 0.6% for the full year. On an organic basis, excluding revenues from our XO acquisition, segment revenues declined in the quarter by 3.6%. Growth from our high quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. Consumer markets’ revenue decreased 1.4% in the quarter as Fios internet growth was overshadowed by declines in video and copper.\\nFor the full year, consumer revenues grew by 0.2%. Consumer Fios revenue grew by 1.7% in the quarter. Fios revenue growth is primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher internet speeds, including our gigabit connection launched early in 2017. In the quarter, we added 47,000 Fios internet customers.\\nWe now have a total of about 5.9 million Fios internet subscribers representing a 40.1% penetration rate. In Fios video, the business faced ongoing headwinds as observed throughout the linear TV market. The Fios video business ended with 29,000 subscriber losses in the quarter and 75,000 for the year.\\nOur multiuse fiber initiative is progressing as expected. This provides the foundational layer for multiple ways to interface with a wide array of customers and is the cornerstone of our intelligent edge network. We launched our partnership with Boston in 2016 and are seeing good results in that area. We announced our public private partnership with Sacramento in June of 2017, and you will see more activity from us on this front as progressive municipalities work with Verizon to bring new technologies to their communities.\\n\\nFor the quarter, excluding XO, Enterprise Solutions revenue decreased 4.1%. New customer wins and growth in advanced communications products were more than offset by secular and pricing pressures in our legacy offerings and technologies. Partner Solutions revenue, excluding XO, decreased 5.8%. Strong demand for fiber access is a growth opportunity for this business. In business markets revenue declined 5.6% without XO.\\nWe are competing and winning with our fiber-based products but continue to see declines in legacy technologies. Segment EBITDA margin was 20.9% for the quarter and 21.1% for the year. Our commitments, operational gains and efficiencies in the business were largely offset by content cost escalations producing a stable margin profile. Let’s move next to Slide 9 to discuss our media and Telematics businesses.\\nOur integration efforts for the Oath assets are progressing ahead of schedule. We remain focused on exploiting synergies across all of that media assets to create a streamline platform with rich engaging content and simple functionality. For the quarter Oath revenue is $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately 10% sequentially. As expected revenue trends were driven by increase appetizing spend during the holiday season and we expect to see the normal seasonality from fourth quarter to first quarter. Our Telematics business which includes Fleetmatics and Telogis continues to grow. Total Telematics revenue increased to just over $230 million. IoT revenues increased approximately 8% in the quarter on an organic basis. Our solution set is evolving as our engagement with municipalities gains more momentum with increasing multi-use fiber deployments and the commercial rollout of 5G services.\\nLet\\'s move next to Slide 10 to discuss our cash flows. In 2017 cash flow from operations totaled $25.3 billion including the $2.1 billion net after tax discretionary pension funding and the $6.0 billion impact from completing the transition to on balance sheet device payment receivable financing. On a year-over-year basis our cash flow has improved by $2.5 billion. As expected full year capital expenditures were $17.2 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $8.1 billion and does not include $4.3 billion of proceeds from asset backed securitizations.\\nThe transition to on balance sheet accounting for device payment plan receivables and funding is now substantially complete. Changes going forward will mostly reflect seasonality and wireless equipment volumes. We ended the year with $117.1 billion of total debt comprised of $108.2 billion of unsecured debt and $8.9 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Our new term unsecured maturities are modest to $2.3 billion through the end of 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us the financial flexibility to methodically investor growth in the business. \\nNow let\\'s take a look at 2018 on Slide 11. As Lowell mentioned upfront out strategic priorities of 2018 are clear. Our focus is on executing on the fundamentals which positions the business’ strong performance in the upcoming year. We expect year-over-year consolidated revenue to grow at low single-digits in 2018 on a GAAP reported basis. Excluding the impact from the near revenue recognition standard we are on track to achieve year-over-year wireless service growth by the middle part of 2018.\\nAs we disclosed in our January 17, 2018 8-K filing the new revenue standard will negatively impact wireless service revenue. Inclusive of the new standard we expect wireless service revenue growth to turn positive towards the end of 2018 or early 2019.\\nThe benefits of our business excellence initiative included the deployment of zero based budgeting will begin to show up in our results in 2018. We expect low single digit growth in adjusted earnings per share which includes the diluted impacts from the full year of depreciation and amortization cost from 2017 acquisitions. The straight path acquisition expected to close later in the first quarter. And the ongoing impact of the last year\\'s data centered divestitures. This is before the impact of tax reform on the revenue recognition standard.\\n\\nIn terms of tax legislation we expect the savings to generate a net $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion uplift to cash flows from operations in 2018 and is expected to yield a $0.55 to $0.65 increase to EPS in 2018. [Net of our] employee initiative and contributions to the Verizon foundation that Lowell mentioned earlier. The resulting 2018 effective tax rate for Verizon is projected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Lowell stated earlier there are internal capital decision process and return objectives have not changed. We are consistent and methodical in our allocation. We expected consolidated capital spending to be between $17.0 billion and $17.8 billion including the commercial launch of 5G. With that I will turn the call back over to Brady, so we can get your questions.\\nBrady Connor\\nThank you Matt. Brad we are now ready to take questions.\\nQuestion-And-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan. You may go ahead.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nHi, thanks. One for Matt and one for Lowell if I can. First Matt, I wonder if you can talk about the company\\'s target leverage and is there any change in your thoughts or the discussions with the rating agencies on what appropriate EBITDA multiple when your conversion from EBITDA to cash flow is now substantially better because of lower taxes and then Lowell can you please discuss Verizon’s view of the attractiveness of media assets in general? A year ago you offered a definitive no on any interest in buying big media and yet Verizon has been thrown out as a potential buyer and nearly every media M&A story of 2017 which has probably been confusing for your investors. Can you just give us an update? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nGood morning Phil. I will take the first question. So the target leverage we haven\\'t specified an exact number there but as we have said consistently we want to strengthen the balance sheet. The additional proceeds from the benefit of tax reform allow us to get there little faster. The key here is to have a strong balance sheet that allows us to pursue and execute on our strategy as quickly and as efficiently as we can. So as we say we haven\\'t given an exact leverage target but you should expect us to deleverage from where we are today. We said previously getting into the same type of profile that we had prior to the Vodafone transaction, so I think that gives you a general review at the direction we would like to head. In terms of the rating agencies not had any specific conversations with them since tax reform happened about how that may change their views but certainly it gives us the ability to bring the leverage down at a little faster rates and we look forward to doing that through [‘18] and we will continue to have conversations with them and put the balance sheet in a place where it continues to support the business.\\nLowell McAdam\\nAnd Phil, good morning. I guess my first comment is I guess it\\'s nice to be loved. So there certainly is a lot of interest here which frankly we ignored. But I think in seriousness there is a lot of movement in this area right now and we don\\'t even know whether AT&T is going to get approved. It\\'s clear that the messages that Disney and Fox are sending is that scale matters. So we look at this but you have to take a look at whether being a big independent distributor is a reasonable alternative to owning content. And I think until all of this shakes out you really can\\'t determine whether that\\'s a path we would be interested in but I can say unequivocally there is nothing going on right now without considering a large media play. In fact if you look at our actions things like the NBA and the NFL announcement that we have made in the last few weeks we think being a great partner being able to monetize through advertising and being independent is a very good place to play for us right now. And that\\'s still further notice that\\'s what our investors should assume we are doing.\\n\\nPhilip Cusick\\nThat\\'s helpful. Thanks Lowell, thanks, Matt.\\nLowell McAdam\\nBrad, let\\'s take the next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.\\nSimon Flannery\\nGreat, thank you very much and good morning. And one for Matt and Lowell as well. Matt, can you just help us with the math from Q4 to Q1 around the revenue recognition. You\\'re moving some revenues from service revenues to equipment and then you should get at least a temporary EBITDA and EPS left. If you can just give us a little bit more color around what we should be modeling there.\\nAnd then Lowell, you obviously went through the 5G role in a lot of detail in November or a couple of months past. Can you give us a little bit more clarity about what we should be expecting for the rest of the year, when should we see Sacramento launching, what about announcing from the other cities? How many pops should we be expecting covered in 2018 and then into \\'19? Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, Simon. So, I\\'ll take the first part of that on the adoption of revenue recognition. So, a couple of things that firstly we created an opening balance sheet adjustment to reflect some of the treatment of open contracts, assuming they had been recorded under the new standard.\\nRemember, unlike most adoption of accounting standards, the prior periods are not being recast and so you\\'ll have it all difference between the accounting standards for the 2018 numbers versus the 2017 comparison. You\\'ll see that so as we go through the year. And we report \\'18 on the new standard. We\\'ll also give a view as what \\'18 would have looked like if it\\'s been under the old standard as well.\\nSo, in terms of breaking those pieces apart as we said in AK last week, total revenue won\\'t have any significant impact from the change but there will be a change in geography. We\\'ll record more equipment revenue unless service revenue initially based off that change and how we treat contracts that are still subsidized which is primarily our B2B contracts.\\nAnd in the biggest impact of the EBITDA line\\'s going to come from how we treat commissions and rather than taking those commission expenses and expensing them immediately when they\\'re incurred, they\\'ll get spread over the life of or the estimated life of the underlying customer contract.\\nNow, the opening balance sheet adjustment is only for the open contracts that had a 24-month commitment or promo cost. So, it doesn\\'t relate to all of the contracts. So, that\\'s why you\\'ll see a build-up in that over the next two years. So, we said the net benefit in \\'18 to be about $0.9 billion to $1.2 billion because of the change in accounting standards; most of that coming from the commission\\'s line.\\nWe didn’t break it up by quarter but I think you should expect it not to be too dissimilar from quarter-to-quarter as we go through the year. And then the impact in \\'18 would be bigger than it will be in \\'19 and then it\\'ll be largely immaterial by the time we get to \\'20 because that contract asset builds up on the balance sheet. We\\'ll reach a plateau level where the ins and outs are equal, by the time we get into \\'18 they won\\'t be materially different.\\nSo, hopefully that answers your question on rev rec.\\nSimon Flannery\\nThank you.\\nLowell McAdam\\nOkay, and Simon on 5G. As you indicated, we shared a lot of information in November. The trials are continuing to go extremely well for us. We have more than 200 sites up online. We continue to learn every day. The distances that we shared are and the throughputs are very consistent up to about 2000 feet, which is much better than we expected.\\nWe\\'re doing more testing around throughputs. We\\'re seeing 10 Gigabits of peak throughputs. So, we\\'re very comfortable with being able to deliver a gigabit of service at everyone that we\\'re providing service to. As you may have seen the new standard, the global standard was approved in December and we\\'ve announced with Qualcomm bringing chips online that will fit that standard in the second half of \\'18.\\n\\nSo, we will be deploying with our proprietary standard but also very quickly in \\'18 coming on with the global standard as well. If you saw what was going on at CES, there was a lot of discussion about devices and we believe that there will be mobile devices late in 2018 and then more available as we get into 2019.\\nIf you saw just last week, the FCC approved our purchase of straight path and so we\\'re excited about moving that forward to close. So, as far as execution goes and pops, we\\'re placing the fiber that we need now as we shared and I know you were there. In November, we shared the number of incremental sites that you need over a densified 4G network, is much smaller than we had expected.\\nSo, we\\'re not seeing that sort of capital intensity that some were assuming. So, as you indicated, we\\'ve announced Sacramento. We have three to five plan for the year. I am personally out meeting with some of the mayors talking about what we\\'re going to be providing and the reception has been extremely positive.\\nSo, as you know, it takes a little while to work through the city governments and get these things approved. But Sacramento is a terrific model for us. We continue to build that partnership and I wouldn’t suspect it\\'ll be too much longer before you\\'ll see the other cities announce. And then we can be more specific on pops.\\nBut as far as capital goes, Matt told you what our guidance was for the year. We are reallocating the capital that we have been spending. We don’t see any upward pressure of this in this year. And we\\'ll be able to determine the return on invested capital as we go through these trials in these commercial launches and we\\'ll share more information as the year moves along.\\nSimon Flannery\\nGreat, thank you very much.\\nLowell McAdam\\nOkay, Brad. Let\\'s take the next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nThanks, guys. Either for from Matt or Lowell. Can you guys talk about the low single-digit GAAP earnings guidance which I assume includes straight path and the $0.5 to $0.6 from increase in the charitable contribution? Talk about the some of the underlying drivers of that. You\\'ve seen wireless cap our EBITDA margins continue to move up, some pressure on the wireline side.\\nIs that what we can expect for 2018 and talk about how you see that the competitive environment evolving in the wireless market that may support continue to increase in margins on that side? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. Thanks, John. Good morning. So, year-end ago we talked about the low single-digit GAAP earnings. And we talked about a few below-the-line items in the straight path will be dilutive because we\\'re largely paying for that transaction in shares. And you will see an uptick in D&A cost because of the transactions we did last year.\\nBut we\\'re confident the underlying earnings are improving. You\\'re seeing that come through the service revenue on the wireless side to the business. You saw that number improve to just a negative 2.9 in the fourth quarter. And then we said on an apples-to-apples basis getting back to flat-to-positive by the middle part of the year.\\nSo, excited that we\\'ve completed that journey of transitioning the base and look forward to continuing to see wireless revenue growth from there. Wireline, I think in 2018 will be on a similar trajectory that you\\'ve seen in the past couple of years. Although as we continue to deploy more fiber in the network, it gives us opportunities to replace some of those earnings that were on copper based products with fiber based products which should be more sustainable going forward.\\nSo, net you should certainly see an improvement in the earnings profile of the company versus the last couple of years. And then you mentioned the charitable contribution in your comment. I want to be clear that the guide is before the impact of tax reform and revenue recognition and when we say before the impact of tax reform we also mean the net impact of tax reform which includes the contribution to the foundation and the employee piece.\\n\\nSo, the low single-digit EPS guide is before that $0.5 to $0.6 impact of those couple of initiatives Lowell described, which is baked into that $0.55 to $0.65 positive impact from tax reform. So, hopefully that gives you a little more clarity on the moving parts within there. But it\\'s built off the underlying earnings profile been stronger year-over-year.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nOkay. Thanks, Matt.\\nLowell McAdam\\nBrad, we\\'re ready for the next question.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.\\nBrett Feldman\\nThanks for taking the question. I\\'ve got two follow-ups here around the impact of tax reforms. You talked a bit about how you\\'re going to be taking advantage of some of the benefits you\\'re going to see. I\\'m curious if we could expand on that.\\nDo you see an opportunity to maybe reinvest some of the savings in your competitive behavior meaning we\\'ve had kind of a com period here to end of year, you\\'ve invested a lot in your business? Is there an opening here for you to maybe spend a bit more to get customers revisit your network or even just to get your existing customers to maybe move into newer devices, whether it can take advantage of some of your network investments even making recently.\\nAnd then just also, we\\'re kind of hoping that at a broader corporate level you\\'ll see a lot of changes in behavior. You obviously have relationships with large enterprises. I know its early days but in your discussions with them, are you seeing any green shoes that perhaps will start increasing investments in their businesses and ways that can maybe have a positive lateral implication for your enterprises services segment down the road? Thanks.\\nLowell McAdam\\nOkay. Well, let me start out Brett, on that, and then Matt and certainly add in. on the competitive front, you\\'ve been around me for years. I have said from 1983, when I got involved in telecom and wireless, that it\\'s an extremely competitive market. And that competition can come from different places at different times but it\\'s always very strong.\\nVerizon has never been one to lead the market down from a price perspective and we\\'re certainly not going to change that now. Our focus inside the business is to use the assets that we have in our portfolio today like owe to be competitive in ways that the others can\\'t compete. And as we roll 5G out, we see much more opportunity to be innovative as a way to be competitive versus using tax reform to just take our prices down.\\nNow, on your enterprise front. I think we\\'ve all been very pleased at how the market and the economy has run up here since tax reform. And just like we\\'re positioning ourselves to be able to execute and accelerate our strategies, I see other businesses doing the same thing. And telecom is such an important part to the productivity measures of a lot of these enterprises, we do see the opportunity to pick this up.\\nBut we remember we\\'re only 30 days end of the tax reform process and we\\'re all trying to understand the implications and what we can accelerate and how we can accelerate. So, where we build our fiber, where we\\'re deploying 5G, what enterprises are telling us they want to do with our Intelligent Edge Network is influencing where we put our capital dollars. And I expect this to continue and I expect to see things pickup.\\nBrett Feldman\\nAlright, thank you.\\nLowell McAdam\\nBrad, let\\'s take the next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may ask your question.\\nDavid Barden\\nHey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe a couple of quick clarifications from Matt and one for Lowell. Matt, so just following up on that EPS guide to be clear, the low single-digit guidance does include the benefit from the change in the accounting for the handset related selling costs. And just to clarify that.\\n\\nAnd then the second on the cash flow guidance, the $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion cash flow benefit, is that a sequential year-over-year benefit or is that a benefit relative to what you\\'re expecting to pay in cash taxes in 2018. And then Lowell, if I could just ask, you\\'ve done a number of things on fiber both organic builds in terms of Boston for instance, acquisitions of XO and then more creative partnerships like on the WOW front.\\nCan you kind of talk a little about as we look into \\'18, \\'19, kind of the path forward on fiber infrastructure in supporting the 5G build. Is it more of an organic game plan from here on out or are they still on ways to make acquisitions on that front? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, David. So, your second question to me the cash flow guide, the $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion that is compared to what our 2018 cash taxes would have been without tax reform. So, it\\'s not a comparison against 2017\\'s cash taxes. It\\'s just the 2018 impact with and without tax reform.\\nOn the EPS guide, maybe I\\'ll try to say in this little clearer. The EPS guide is our view on the business without revenue recognition and without tax reform. So, then you lay on top of that number, the impact of revenue recognition that we gave in the AK last week and you also lay on top the $0.55 to $0.65 increase in EPS that I described in the prepared remarks earlier this morning.\\nSo, hopefully that does that help clear up the EPS question?\\nDavid Barden\\nSorry, Matt. Because the revenue recognition is one thing but there is an expense recognition change, that\\'s a separate thing that\\'s a benefit between $900 million and $1.2 billion.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nRight.\\nDavid Barden\\nAnd I was just wondering if that\\'s included in the single-digit or not included in the single-digit?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nIt is not included in the single-digit, you add it on to the single-digit guidance.\\nDavid Barden\\nPerfect, thank you.\\nLowell McAdam\\nOkay. Then David, so your question kind of boils down to or is it organic or is it M&A and where do we see deploying fiber. So, just for everyone else on the call, we have done some M&A. XO had a fair amount of fiber and WideOpenWest had fiber that we did by M&A.\\nBut we also announced our deal with Corning, which is a multi-year deal where we\\'re doing 12.5 million miles of fiber per year for the next three years. So, that would tell you we\\'re sort of tilting toward organic. And our priorities are really what can we do to get off of others lease services to meet our 4G cell densification needs, then 5G, and then our enterprise customers.\\nAnd we\\'re out in markets now obviously placing fiber but it\\'s a market-by-market analysis of the three factors that I just talked about. And frankly, the cities the meeting that we\\'re having with the cities and what access they will give us to street furniture and conduit and those sorts of things factor into the equation.\\nSo, it\\'s a bit fluid at this point and I wouldn’t tell you that if an opportunity came up to accelerate it through M&A, we would do it, but most of the fiber companies were built for different purposes. They were point-to-point enterprise sort of services and they don’t fit the architecture that we\\'re building today which is multi-use fiber for Intelligent Edge Network.\\nSo, and I hope that\\'s clear enough for you but certainly leaning toward organic builds to meet Verizon needs to drive our cost down in our performance up.\\nDavid Barden\\nThanks guys, I appreciate it.\\nLowell McAdam\\nBrad, we\\'re ready for the next question.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Your line is open.\\nMichael Rollins\\nHi, good morning. Question for Matt as well as a question for Lowell. First Matt, can you talk about the strength in wireless phone that adds in the fourth quarter in a bit more detail and can you also describe what you\\'re seeing from two of the changes in the competitive over the past 12 months which is cable starting to sell wireless subscription and also some of your competitors bundling in video services.\\n\\nAnd Lowell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the vision at Verizon. As you look at what you\\'re investing in the mobile business, fiber infrastructure, 5G, is there a broader vision inside the company that you want to provide broadband access to as many premises as well as mobile customers across the country?\\nAnd is there some vision of what proportion of the country you may be able to reach in three to five years as you take all of these things together that you\\'re dealing as a company? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, Mike. So, I\\'ll start off with the wireless front question and then Lowell can get onto fiber. Look, we had a great year on the wireless performance. The net ads were very strong as I mentioned, our smartphone net ads at 1.8 million for the year up 34% year-over-year.\\nSo, we really saw a significant change. Today we launched unlimited back in February of last year and from that point forward, we have competed very effectively in the marketplace and it really allow customers to have a similar currency to compare different carriers on and the value proposition is resonating.\\nAnd despite all the noise that you hear from other people and the claims you hear from other people, the network quality matters. We saw that numerous times throughout the year and we see that in the performance we had on net ads whether it be the new activations coming in or the churn that we\\'d had.\\nSo, each of the last three quarters of the year, phone churn was below 0.8% and I think that tells you how much customers enjoy being on the Verizon network. So, you ask about the game of source. Look, we\\'re happy of what we\\'ve seen so far. Obviously, Comcast is on and Charter has said they expect to be on later this year.\\nAnd as we say consistently we like those agreements and we signed them in 2011 and we\\'re happy to be doing them today. And we\\'ll see how they play out but everything we\\'ve seen so far is in line with our expectations and we\\'re glad to have that traffic on that network and monetize in that traffic based on what those companies are doing with those agreements.\\nAnd in terms of what the competitors are doing. Look, they bundle a number of things into their services during the course of last year and our numbers have staid very consistent. So, at the end of the day, the quality of the network that the device is on is of fundamental importance. And overall, when you look at our value proposition, it continues to resonate strongly.\\nAnd let\\'s say we\\'re very happy with the results we had last year and starting off 2018 on the [front foot].\\nLowell McAdam\\nOkay Mike, let me take where we want to have from infrastructure in a vision perspective. Look, I think it\\'s very clear here whether you look at what\\'s going on today with customers or what you\\'re anticipating that you saw at CES and others from what\\'s next that there is an insatiable demand for broadband.\\nAnd it\\'s not mobile and it\\'s not fixed. It, customers don’t care and I think who wins is going to be able to provide them the service that they can move seamlessly from fixed to mobile. We have been a much stronger mobile company over the years but the way we\\'re positioning our fiber deployment and the way we\\'re positioning 5G, we will be able to disregard geography and deploy those broadband services at a much lower cost than we\\'ve ever seen at least during my career.\\nNow for us to complete the vision, you need to be able to provide sort of those internet information services and video drives an awful lot of that. And we talked at length about taking the Oath assets to be that information source around news boards, finance and entertainment and lifestyle. And we think that the assets that we have will provide what customers need.\\nSo, and you look at the applications going forward, they will whether it\\'s medical and healthcare services, whether it\\'s smart cities, whether it\\'s education, whether it\\'s autonomous cars and transportation systems, you\\'re going to need that sort of seamless high bandwidth. And we lump that under the title human ability.\\n\\nSo, our focus is around giving all of our customers the capabilities to embrace these applications, so the future that are going to make their lives so much better. And so our investments they are all about providing the assets in the platforms to deliver that.\\nMichael Rollins\\nThanks, very much.\\nLowell McAdam\\nBrad, let\\'s take the next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead with your question.\\nCraig Moffett\\nHi, good morning. A question about your capital budgeting process in the light of tax reform. Just given that the returns on a whole range of projects will now have been boosted by both the lower tax rate and the accelerated depreciation. Does that change your priorities with respect to capital investment or are there some specific types of projects whether it\\'s deploying fiber or that sort of thing that now pops in front of the queue as being meaningfully more attractive than they were.\\nAnd how should we think about that with respect to the total size of your capital budget going forward?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell Craig, I\\'ll take that and then Matt can jump in. I guess you could accuse us of being boring but you at least should give us credit for being consistent.\\nWe have been extremely disciplined and then when we see an opportunity, we go hard. And you saw that in 3G, you saw that in 4G and you\\'re going to see it and you\\'re seeing it in 5G in placing fiber. We see a real opportunity here. We were the ones that stood up and said two years ago when everybody said we are way too early but we\\'ve been deliberate about it.\\nWe\\'ve gone out, we\\'ve done the field trials, we\\'ve developed the ecosystem, we worked with partners from Korea as well as the infrastructure providers were out there as I said with 200 sale sites today learning and we\\'re going to see what commercially happens in these three to five cities. Then we\\'ll make the decision.\\nSo, to us it\\'s a very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we\\'re all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline. What tax reform does do is it gives us great flexibility that once we prove to ourselves that we can get a reasonable return on invested capital, we can accelerate very rapidly. And that gets the match point about we want to early on strengthen that balance sheet to give us the flexibility.\\nBut the strategies there and we are all sort of like a spring ready to expand very quickly if we need to. But we have to get through another couple of hurdles here before we make those decisions and we\\'re not ready to say that in January of \\'18 but I certainly hope by fourth quarter results next year we\\'re accelerating because we\\'ve got such a great story to tell.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThe only other thing I\\'d add to that, Craig, and I\\'d kind of come back to the comments that Hans Vestberg made earlier this month that \"In our Industry, the nature of the way that we spend money, having significant increases and decreases is in a fashion the way we deploy CapEx.\" So, we\\'re certainly looking at given as you say tax reform can change that some of the return math, but we\\'ll be methodical about it.\\nAnd there\\'s a lot of planning that goes into our capital spending before we get to it. And so, that\\'s why you see us making the comments we do. We certainly look forward having the right opportunities in front of us. But you will us do it methodically and do it in the way that creates the greatest value.\\nCraig Moffett\\nThanks.\\nLowell McAdam\\nBrad, we\\'re ready for the next question.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nJennifer Fritzsch\\nOkay. Thank you for taking the question. Two, if I may. One, the inevitable spectrum question. With T Mobile’s purchases in the broadcast [auction] may have I think two times the amount of low band spectrum. Well, you have a kind of millimeter way spectrum, some may say or as might say as how the eggs are in that basket. How do you think of that?\\n\\nAnd then second if I could get some math around David\\'s question earlier. You mentioned moving away from leases, can you quantify how much right now you\\'re paying them back house to them about cyber providers same class?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWhy don’t I take the spectrum question? As you say, Jennifer, \"the inevitable question.\" Look, there is going to be an awful lot of noise around deployment of 5G. If you recall back when we deployed 4G, there was a big scramble for everybody to try to get 3G to look like 4G and we called it 4G Faux. And you\\'re seeing some of the same stuff right now.\\nIn order to do 5G and this is right out of the standard which we certainly agree with, you need at least a 100 megahertz of bandwidth to provide the latency, the reliability, the throughputs that really are the 5G promise. I can take 5G and I can put it on 10 megahertz of PCS if I want to. It won\\'t perform like 5G, it will be the technology but it won\\'t have the reliability, it won\\'t have the throughput and it won\\'t have the latency.\\nSo, you\\'re going to get a lot of this, well they need this or they are depending on whether your selling spectrum or what you\\'ve got in your basket of spectrum today. But I wouldn’t change positions with anybody out there. I\\'ve got plenty of low band spectrum that works great for 4G, it\\'s going to serve us for years to come.\\nBut in order to put all of the aspects of 5G into play, you need 100s of megahertz of bandwidth. The only one who has that in a big way in the market place is us.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nAnd so, I\\'ll just add one other piece to that, I agree exact low set about 5G and you should think about 4G network. We\\'ve always said these three things. Spectrum is a densification in the architecture and then the technology. I can tell you over the past few months there\\'s been a number of technology upgrades to the network and you will see in that in the network performance a number of those we deployed in the back end of the fourth quarter, so significant amount of additional capacity being added to the network as we head into \\'18, again without having to go acquire additional spectrum.\\nBut I do expect you to ask that question on those who\\'s going forward. It would be a kind of a miss if people didn\\'t. In terms of your question on how much we are paying back on fiber end, that\\'s not a number we disclose. We really don\\'t break out the income statement by individual line items, we\\'re not going to start doing that now. But I would just say as we think about fiber, we look at the most economic way of getting it irrespective of where it shows up in the financial statements and we\\'ll continue to do that.\\nJennifer Fritzsch\\nThank you.\\nLowell McAdam\\nHey Brad, we have time for one more question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. You may ask your question.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nThanks, very much. Late last year, Lowell, you had highlighted a goal for $10 billion in cost cuts over the next few years. I was wondering how should we think about the areas where you believe the biggest opportunities for cost reductions are and how should we think about those cost cuts filtering in through the company over the next couple of years?\\nAnd then secondly, I was wondering if going back to the 5G topic, if you can touch upon whether you believe that fiber will be a competitive advantage in this world. Clearly you folks are making a significant amount of investment to get the necessary densification capillarity that you need for fiber. Others seemed to be working with cable providers to improve densification and back haul, do you believe that this is a viable alternative versus what you guys are doing or do you believe that at this point in time you are setting the stage for a longer term competitive mode as 5G comes to commercial positioning?\\n\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, Amir. Let me take the first one on the $10 billion number over the next four years that Lowell mentioned in September and we have talked about little since then. Look, what every area of the business is where we\\'re looking and we believe that there is opportunities across every area of the business. Obviously network; cost are significant part, distribution; is something we\\'re taking a close look at customer care or the back office type activities.\\nEssentially there is no area of the business it isn\\'t going to get examined as part of this exercise because this imperative we make sure that we\\'re as efficient a company as we can be as we go forward. From a timing standpoint, I can tell you we\\'ve embedded the 2018 targets for this activity in each of the business units operating plans for the year. And I look forward to discussing the results that we achieved on this as we go forward in \\'18 and into the future.\\nLowell McAdam\\nAnd then Amir, I guess my answer on the fiber competitive advantage is, throughout my career I have always believed and it\\'s been reinforced many times that if you\\'ve got a critical component of your success, you better own it and control it. And that fits with our direct distribution, it fits with a lot of our customer service. We don\\'t outsource sales. We certainly wouldn\\'t outsource critical components of our network.\\nAs Hans has come in and put in our architecture for Intelligent Edge, owning that fiber asset is important to our financial performance as well as the performance of the network. And as we\\'ve seen time-and-time again, network competitive advantage drives customers which ultimately drives financial. So, you won\\'t see us outsource much in the way of network unless someone has a huge scale advantage and we could negotiate very strong performance and very consistent financials that would go along with it.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nThank you very much for the incremental color.\\nBrady Connor\\nThat\\'s all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I would like to turn it back over to Lowell for some closing comments.\\nLowell McAdam\\nThanks, Brady. So just a couple of final points from me. I don\\'t come on these calls very often. I like to save that for when we\\'ve got significant changes in the business. And obviously, tax reform and our use of those funds was important for us to clarify.\\nBut there was a second reason for me to come on and I have been in this industry for 30 years and I think we\\'re breaking into one of the most exciting times that I\\'ve seen in my career. We are on the cusp of what I call the fourth industrial revolution as we see smart city applications, the changes in medical, the changes in transportation and education; all of those are fueled by a strong telecommunications infrastructure.\\nSo, I think this is a great time for our industry overall. Obviously, I think Verizon is the best positioned to deliver that future. We\\'ve had a long history of strong operational and financial performance. We\\'re investing in the media platforms and the fiber assets and the network and in the new technologies to meet the needs that are coming forward.\\nAnd I think as I said that will be a major change in the way people live, work and play. So, I am very excited about 2018, what lies ahead for us. I look forward to sharing the results and the successes as we move forward in this year and coming on a call next year at this time and recapping one of the best years in our history.\\nSo, with that we\\'ll close the call and we appreciate all of your time today.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you, for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect.', '/article/4130535-verizon-communications-vz-management-presents-barclays-global-financial-service-conference': \"Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference 2017 December  7, 2017 12:30 PM ET\\nExecutives\\nEd Chan - Senior Vice President of Technology, Strategy and Planning\\nAnalysts\\nAmir Rozwadowski - Head of the U.S. Telecom Services and Communications Infrastructure Research Practice \\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nGood morning everyone. For those of you that don’t know me, my name is Amir Rozwadowski, I head up the U.S. Telecom Services and Communications Infrastructure Research Practice here at Barclays. It's with great pleasure that we have with us today, Ed Chan, the Senior Vice President of Technology, Strategy and Planning at Verizon to discuss with us all things network-related. So, thanks very much for being with us here today.\\nEd Chan\\nThank you for having me with me again.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nEd, do you want to do a little safe harbor?\\nEd Chan\\nYes. Let me do - that's funny. As you all know, we have a bunch of forward-looking information here. If you could go to our website on our Investor Relations website, you'll find our safe harbor statements there. Some of these statements that I will make would be forward-looking.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nFantastic, Ed. So again, it's a great pleasure having you with us on stage again today. We've had the pleasure of discussing all things network-related for some time now in a number of years, but perhaps for the benefit of those that have not had the chance to hear you speak in the past, can you provide us with a bit of color on your role at Verizon and some of the responsibilities if you have anything.\\nEd Chan\\nI have the best role in Verizon. The way I see it, I get to pick on what I would like to play with and pick out what the right technology path is, just think of me as the, what is the - in telecom the chief network architect. So, which means that my job is to plan the network on what technologies we should pick, how do we shift that to a digital future? What should the long-term plan look like? It kind of cuts across both products and networks and how we go to market in terms of the digital technology looks like for the customer side as well?\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nFantastic. And clearly network leadership has always been a corner stone for Verizon’s strategy, do you believe that this is as important today as it has been in the past? In other words, do you think that network quality of service will be increasingly important in the future?\\nEd Chan\\nThank you. I, you know, this is a no doubt for me, as you know, I look at how we have come from the years past all the way to now, and if you think about the way that the world is digitizing and the access to information is getting increasingly more and more important, and even today, if you look at, even a few years back you will say, does it really matter, if your smart phone isn't working when get landed a new city, you realize that the most beloved taxi-hailing application that you may want to use is going to rely on how you use it. \\nNow, back a few years ago, I was saying, no, I didn't even think that that may be a natural application that runs on a network. So, I would think that as you move forward, as you see even the mixed industrial change as we talk about AI and ML, right some of the artificial intelligence that is coming to the kind of the forefront of how we can become even more efficient.\\nYou see that the ability to connect and get the information and get the data to even process the AI information that is best to do so, you find that’s increasingly even more important going into the future. So, it is very hard for me to think that networks would be even less critical in the future when everything that we do was practically living in the cloud.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nWell, and you guys seem to have stirred the pot a little bit about that network discussion more recently, you know where you looking dial into your 5G strategy a bit here. You know the onset of this year you folks had announced that you were testing in several markets and more recently you started to shed some light in terms of what those tests have had provided in terms of color. Can you talk to us or provide us with an update on what you have learned from these initial trials, specifically what types of speed, reach, any other insights that you've had?\\n\\nEd Chan\\nYes, I even step back just a little bit about how we have come to this stage, even when we have first started looking into this a few years back that I would say, four five years ago. Some of you heard us talk a little bit about, we need to identify the network a little further. So, we actually had thought even back then that the millimeter wave is going to start coming into the network for use. So, we started to singing or architecting the network to essentially figure out how to build this future with a multiuse fiber backbone, centralizing the radio network, and then ultimately adding on their wave into it.\\nSo, when we shift this into 5G, we kind of knew this was coming. Now the fact that then people would tell you, all small cells that’s not going to happen, so now you're getting to a place where everybody is saying those things are actually true now, that is actually okay to go after and deploy small cell in densifying the network, so you're now hearing saying the same thing. So, if there are some things happening with 5G for us, we started off a couple of years ago saying look the standard is just way too far, the industry really needed a shift and a change faster. \\nSo, two years ago we would put bunch of us together, including these chipset providers, manufacturers for OEMs, for devices, as well as folks that does the network infrastructure and we created a specification and once that started, we took this to trial like you said this year and so let us put it in front of actual customers, and let them tell us what does this look like. So, I would say with 10 mm wave and the way in which we approached that particular trial it was very successful pieces that we found.\\nI would tell you as an engineer, it is - the basic stuff that we tested, a thousand feet and below, most people would say, yes, we understand that - that works and we all agree that that work. Then we started saying, would it work from 1000 to 2000 feet? And we are pleasantly surprised that we also find those areas that actually does work and we said how far can you push it. So, we were targeting the essentially gigabit services that we can get up to and see how far we can push that envelope and we got it all the way out to 2,600 feet and be able to get at least a giga service in this in that case.\\nSo, there are a couple of things that along the way we have found very interesting that engineers were always there, the physics doesn’t work, this is how it is, but I think sometimes we underestimate how much technologies can actually change the way in which your engineer systems are like this. So, it is a bunch of learning that you get from this, but the results that we get essentially is that we, the ability for the silicon to actually track the beams is no longer the same as we used to do with millimeter wave systems.\\nSo, what we find now is that, with what we thought was impossible thing, so would it even get past any kind of trees and vegetation. Would they get through low-e glass? I'd give you one really weird example where we actually went into a home for an installation and we did not know low-e glass, the big issues that everybody talked about, but yes, low-e glass was a problem.\\nWe actually put the system and actually the antenna right next to the low-e glass and system actually worked. So that is coming kind of surprises that we saw, that was different then when we ran in, we originally thought that from an MTU standpoint, we can go as far as six floors, we got way up passed that up to 24, so there is a lot of these interesting things that we found that is going to be valuable as we move forward into the mobility cases as well. \\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nSo, it almost seems like, if I was to fill some of the comments you made that through these trials the tax seems to be working better than you anticipated is that fair…\\n\\nEd Chan \\nIt is. I would say that is a very fair assumption because I guess in so many ways we are probably among the most conservative engineering folks here, out there, and I would say that we were, we look probably more pessimistic originally when we go into the case, but that surprised us in many cases.\\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nOkay. And then if I think about sort of what the next steps are? I mean, you folks have announced that you would be launching in three to five markets in the next year, you know perhaps that sounds like a small initial launch, could you talk to us to a decision-making process of around those 3 to 5 markets, what is going to be attractive about those markets and you know why are we seeing a larger sort of deployment?\\nEd Chan \\nSo, there are multiple things that played the processing, which we went through and said, look, we took the results from that trial, and then actually went and did the design characteristics of some of those markets and what it looks like. But the other thing that I would also say is that, I have talked a little bit about the customer and how the digitalization of the customer is happening. \\nThe other thing that we started to have to work with and something that is very valuable going to the future also is working with the municipalities, and generally speaking too, we also need to make sure that we get the right municipalities to understand we are coming to bring forth digitalization process also for the actual citizens of that municipality as well, not just for the sake of deploying just home broadband because the next step is the mobility case as well.\\nSo, we wanted to go after a set of cities that we said look, we want to make you a highlight and also as a 5G city, so we went through a process also to kind of combined between the economics of where the right density and the right places are and then also which municipalities may be more progressive in terms of bringing new technologies to the particular city. \\nI would say that the other thing that is pretty interesting is, when we went through this process of engineering the network, what we find is that when we overlay our actual millimeter wave onto our existing 4G sites, I mentioned that we will be densifying the network in so many places, but you realize that it is an incremental addition, it is not a brand-new build for 5G networks.\\nSo, complaining that concept and how we deploy it is how we end up with the 3, 5 cities starting in 2018. And with the, obviously the long-time view being that is what we get to the mobility case, so shift into that second used case at that point.\\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nOne of the things that you had mentioned was, it is not an incremental sort of expansion when it comes to the network. I think one of the things that came out of your 5G update was that you folks don't expect this to really shift the mix or maybe I shouldn't say mix, but it shouldn't really shift the absolute dollars when it comes to investing. Why is that the case? What have you learned from the trials now in terms of densification that that is not actually the case?\\nEd Chan \\nYes, so it is an excellent question, when we did the original thought and overlay, we took a very aggressive approach to say, hey if an engineer needs to work only at a couple hundred feet, what would that look like? And that does make the densification bit higher than what we currently have, but once we went through the trial and figured out what it looks like and overlaid the new millimeter wave onto our existing essentially densified network today, you figured out the fact that you could actually provide a very good coverage even from that perspective, without having - so we stopped getting brand new sites into the network, but changing our existing sites that we , the base stations that we have, and then adding 5G to it, and in the future combining into 4G, 5G network base stations, so that it actually serves both 4G and 5G. So, that’s why at the end of the day the entire investment become a shift from 4G towards 5G as we move forward rather than just a full expansion on just overlaying with 5G. \\n\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nAnd then you had touched upon the idea of ultimately looking forward to the transition to mobile. It does seem like and perhaps you can correct me if I'm wrong, it does seem like the standards organizations have picked up momentum, how do you view that with respect to your own sort of initiatives to build up services starting in 2018?\\nEd Chan\\nAbsolutely. It is actually the - one of the things that we said is that because we have been so active doing the actual work out there. We were out there starting to talk to the chipset providers, like I said at the beginning of couple of years ago, and then actually demonstrating with 11 cities that we trialed in earlier this year. It creates a momentum to drive and most folks would know, if you go back and check before we started actually doing work in this field for 5G. The standards body would be saying yes 2022, we will get some stuff going and imagining some stuff too much.\\nSo, for us, our perspective was let’s get out there and build a network and then the applications would come, because one of the additional new used case is and I was joking early this morning the folks about, we did not even think the smart phone stuff was here, when we first launched 4G, if you think about it. So, it would be practically silly for us to predict all of the applications that is going to show up for 5G. We know the first two.\\nWe know that enhanced mobile broadband, we know that the home broadband, we know those things can be done, but the next sets of applications like AR and VR and things around those line will come, but we can't be the best person to predict that, but to go back to your point, when we drove this effort with all of the work with the different partners with us, you saw the acceleration, so what you will see is that this year, the actual mobility part of the standard from the radio perspective will be done and at that point you will see that the chipset providers' start creating and printing chips, and you will start seeing chips and you will see it even from QUALCOMM who have announced that they will have chipsets available, approximately a year from now. So, they have announced something that they will have in next year.\\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nSo, what does that mean in terms of Verizon's own sort of network structure? I mean it seems as though the path way doing standards-based network build is a lot clearer let’s say a year ago, is that an appropriate assumption?\\nEd Chan\\nIt is, it absolutely is. So, I would say that we essentially see that there is now a clear path to massive scale with the standards body version rather than just the standards version that we created. So, now we know that with the spectrum that we have, we are going to be able to actually shift over to the standards version next year. The other beauty is that with the 11 cities that we are in today those become our - what we call generally the standard and our base mobility test sites.\\nSo, now they become test customers for our mobility testing. So, again those learning that will get not just from this year's trial, but moving forward you are going to start being able to see that we know the engineering team is going to understand just what they would look like as we enter into mobility space.\\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nSo, given that the timing of standards have accelerated, you mentioned the QUALCOMM announcement if I'm not mistaken that was at the millimeter wave, base chipset as well. And the assets that you have in place at the moment, you know once the Straight Path acquisition closes, I mean do you believe that you have a sustainable competitive advantage in 5G at this point?\\nEd Chan\\nYes, I look at it this way. I look at the going back to the architecture and what is necessary to deliver 5G, I looked at three different things, so from asset perspective the ability to have the multiuse fiber, the ability to have the dense network that we already started a few years ago and working with the municipalities all these years, and then the ability to continue the 4G investment into the fourth thesis of what that looks like and combining that with the 5G technology. So, the asset base obviously on that sums back down to the spectrum.\\n\\nSo, from day one we always had that. For 5G, it is not just an improvement on my existing spectrum. Everybody is going to tell you that my existing spectrum will become a 5G spectrum. Okay, so that is a technical discussion of what that looks like because at the end of the day, what we are describing as 5G is, a wideband, a step function change in the bandwidth that is provided to the customer. So, we are talking about hundreds of megahertz of spectrum. \\nSo, when we talk about that kind of needs, you realize that you have to get up to the millimeter wave band and get to some of those at least in the US for the short-term and then we can augment and find out the ones with the SEC, you know with the mid and low band, but in the immediate future, the millimeter wave band is where you have this kind of sizable spectrum to do so. So, on that asset base alone I will say that, clearly, we have the right asset that I am very happy with that we can build a pretty good sustainable differentiated network from that place.\\nAnd then combining that with the, I would say the engineering lining that I talked about, so that now we are ahead of it. It is interesting that there are things that you will find that are a little bit different than the traditional way of engineering the network. So that will carry forward for us as well. And then finally, the consistent investment from a capital perspective is that, as you asked earlier, I think when you combine those pieces together, I don't think there's a debate.\\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nSo, one of the things that you alluded to was sort of RG and other bands, I mean it feels like you folks have been leading charge in terms of the discussion millimeter wave for some time now, but you only speak with global operators, we know there is a lot of folks that are talking about 5G's existence in sub six gigger sideband and correct me if I wrong, but it sounds like you guys aren’t opposed to that or what do you think about it?\\nEd Chan\\nNo, we are not opposed to that at all. I mean it is kind of funny, as I used to see, it depends on what did we all want to do be. I would love to have hundreds of megahertz of spectrum in the sub-6 gigahertz, but you got to look at the industry and the actual country that we are in, and if you look at the U.S. there isn’t such a band available for 6 gigahertz today without any actual long-term action to relocate a lot of folks out of that existing use today. So, that means that is a timing of sequence issue. It means that, the U.S. is not going to wait until such time where we can clear up a few hundreds of megahertz of spectrum available for 5G to be used for us to actually deploy.\\nSo, it means that we will deploy a millimeter wave and then come back and add on the other low bands to it, but again I will go back to the fact that - plus we are talking about not all of the bands that we have today, they are like 20 megahertz channels, you know when you combine them together become 80 megahertz or 100 megahertz or most. So, I’m not talking about the fact that we were just going to make all of our spectrum today slightly better and becomes 5G is spectrums, I’m talking about to deliver a high band incremental or much because step-function of differences, you need bandwidth that's bigger.\\nSo that is why you don't clearly talk about the fact that all my spectrum is 5G today. They all will sound like they are 5G spectrum, but they are not going to provide a same bandwidth as we talked about in the millimeter wave.\\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nLooks very helpful. One of the other areas that we have seen a significant amount of innovation is in the core network. Initiatives such as software defined networking, virtualization, mobile edge computing moving to this intelligent edge architecture, can you provide us with what, any insight in terms of what Verizon has been until we architect its network in that direction.\\n\\nEd Chan\\nIt has been a long journey there also. We’ve been calling the intelligent edge network, what has been happening is that we have been virtualizing if you will, bring a lot of the functions in the core network to software, but in addition to that there is a lot of functional changes in terms of the software being the control point for the fixed assets. So, the ability to control it in an end-to-end manner would be, essentially would be able to help us automate and become a much easier way of doing it, but also sharing that asset. \\nSo, we are essentially using one of the recent item that we created was this multi-services edge platform that is actually software control, but the barrel point, the transport portion is actually common, but we have multiple brains controlling it. So that’s the kind of function that’s going to make you a lot more efficient moving forward. So, foundationally it makes the core network shareable across different items, but the other thing that you brought up when we believed the intelligent edge network becomes is, I am going to now start looking at more cloudlike in the core, but I am also starting to look more cloud like in the edge, all the way to the base station.\\nSo, you are now starting to see us actually having these compute and storage capabilities all the way to the Edge network. And what gets really exciting is, when you get to that 5G place and you add these kind of Edge cloud capabilities, you start to seeing the fact that wow, literally interesting that it feels like the cloud is right in your back pocket when the latency is that short, but when the band with this so high. Today, if you think about it, the cloud is quite a bit further away, the applications are run pretty far away. The bandwidth that needs to go to those data centers is pretty far, but you all of a sudden move that to the Edge and your latency characteristics where your phone can become more like a screen, and just a lot of processing being done there, AR VR becomes a little capability.\\nSo long or something you have to wear a backpack to do it, AR/VR exercise, that your phone can become one. So that is kind of how we believe that this kind of the way in which this intelligent Edge network where you can automate and also orchestrate across the end-to-end, and provide this capability to create services in an end-to-end manner and combining that with the mobile Edge compute with the low-latency side of the network, it's going to be very interesting space.\\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nBut, what does that mean for the cost of running the network? That could a fairly significant reduction.\\nEd Chan\\nYes, there is, we started driving some of those pieces because we have started converging if you will the core network from a converge core perspective and all different stuff but the Edge is where most of these things are - the stand is. So, if you think about it, yes there is a, when you started sharing those, they say massive cost advantage. When we used to have many, many different dedicated Edge is what has allowed us, or even their switches, very specific for may be a private network here, maybe for a public network there, once you take that away and say, look I am just having a single box and is controlled separately and automated, yes, it’s going to be very interesting way of learning a network in that point.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nExcellent, excellent. And then we talk a lot about the future with you in thinking about the network and the network architecture over the next couple of years, and perhaps if I could put things back a little bit, what is horizon doing today to ensure that LTE network doesn’t need to be, you know what type of investments are you making in today's network, what type of new spectrum opportunities, do you see to continue to augment the LTE network as sort of your initiatives on 5G RAM?\\n\\nEd Chan\\nI must say, the number one, it is actually very interesting when I say, we have a very broad network from the very beginning. So, when usage shows up, you actually find that the different time of days, and also different geographies, a network of our size actually can take on those capability and demand much easier than maybe a spot based network, but even more importantly is that we have been seeing so many technology changes that has always been as you say, practically undervalued in terms of the stuff that you bring in. So, as an example we started testing what is called Full-Dimension MIMO, but these are 64 [ph] antennas for 4G alone.\\nI am not talking about the one that I showed last year with the 1000 antenna in the 5G, and a single box of pretty small size, and in those kind of cases, you see that technology stuff is changing, but from a spectrum standpoint, we have been working very closely with the FCC also to try the CBRS-shared spectrum. I have always said this is an industry, I mean the spectrum is one of the most valuable resources for the country. And for us to not use some of those is pretty silly, right? So, we need to help drive that entire ecosystem also to bring the CRBRS spectrum to use, as well as some of the unlicensed spectrum that you know what that will be driving as well.\\nSo, you see those things starting to come along with additional new types of spectrum, all of the LTE advance features that needed the dark fiber and the architecture that I talked about earlier, that’s going to start kicking in this year and into the future. So, 4G is actually from the 4G LTE advance standpoint, still got long ways to go from the technology innovations that I am seeing. So, it’s very interesting.\\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nNow, I know we hit on time, one last question on my end, if you were to leave our audience with one key takeaway, and how we should think about Verizon's network strategies? What would it be?\\nEd Chan\\nI would say, we go back to the very beginning where we truly believe that the customer is going to be relying on the network more and more into the future. So, we believe that with that kind of critical views that the customer is going to be needing, we believe network reliability and network capabilities is going to be critical to that. So that is number one.\\nBut I would also say that we are the doers who want to be out there, actually creating the market, and creating this new feature for the customer so that we're not just sitting back waiting for something to happen or just waiting for the next set of standards, but indeed being out there driving it, with consistent investments we believe that we have the right assets that I have talked about earlier that we will be the one that is going to be leading the market investment.\\nAmir Rozwadowski \\nExcellent. And we wish you best of luck. Thanks very much.\\nEd Chan\\nThank you.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nQ -\", '/article/4129887-verizon-communications-vz-presents-45th-annual-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference': \"Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) 45th Annual UBS Global Media & Communications Conference December  5, 2017  8:00 AM ET\\nExecutives\\nMatthew Ellis - EVP & CFO\\nAnalysts\\nJohn Hodulik - UBS\\nJohn Hodulik\\nOkay, good morning everyone. I'm John Hodulik, the Media and Telecom Analyst here at UBS. And welcome to the second day of our Global Media and Telecom Conference. I'm very pleased to welcome Matt Ellis, the CFO of Verizon, as one of our morning keynote speakers. Matt, thanks for being here.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nGood morning, everyone.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nI think you have some Safe Harbor statement to make and then we can get going.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, so on the screen behind us we've got the Safe Harbor statement. Obviously, we will be making some forward-looking comments this morning and the full statement is available on our website. So, I just draw everyone's attention to that.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nSo, Matt as we sit here in 2017, can you share with us your initial thoughts on priorities for the Company as we look out into 2018?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, so as we think about 2018, the jump off point into that, as you look at performance over the past two months, we’ve really been I think executing very well on the fundamentals whether that be on the customer engagement side, retaining customers, gaining new customers, and then obviously the performance of the network has been incredibly strong and that generated some good results here over the past few months.\\nSo, we will continue on that path. And then as you think about heading into 2018 and the priorities there, it starts off being very confident in the strategy, and so really the priorities for next year are an extension of the things we’ve been talking about this year. And that obviously starts with the network and continuing to build out the intelligent edge network and the additional functionality there.\\nWe will continue to compete to obviously maintain the best base of customers in the industry and also add to that as we go through the year. And then we’ll look to develop the ecosystems that we plan as well whether that'd be 5G, which obviously we announced last week. We expect to launch the residential broadband product in three to five cities in the second half of the year, build out the ecosystem around 5G, and also continue to develop the ecosystems in telematics and digital media and the broader IoT space.\\nSo -- and as we do those things that will allow us to generate solid cash flow. We can strengthen that balance sheet and return value to shareholders. So that will be our priorities as we head into '18.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nThe wireless business has seen an improvement and an inflection in fundamentals and you are growing service revenue on a sequential basis at this point. When can we see sort of return to annual growth? And what are the piece parts that get there?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, next year, as we…\\nJohn Hodulik\\nFirst half, second half.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nWell, we'll get -- we’ll see how the specifics play out. Look, you see the trajectory this year, obviously we came out of the second quarter, we had negative 6.7% from the second quarter and we said okay that’s going to be the low watermark, we said we could see clear line of sight once we -- at that point because the 75% of the base was on unsubsidized pricing by the middle of the year and got to 78% till the end of the third quarter. And we said on both of those occasions that we see service revenues actually getting better from that point. We exit the year under negative 4% and clear line of sight to continuing to do that, and then get back to service revenue growth in 2018.\\nAnd when you kind of break that apart, there’s two main reasons for it. One is just we’re largely through the transition of the base from the old two-year subsidy model to the device payment model where you bifurcate the revenue between service revenue and equipment revenue. So, as I said at the end of third quarter, we were at 78% for the base now on that. And it might move a couple of points higher or so, but not too much because a lot of the B2B business isn’t going through that same transition. So, we’re mostly done with that. When you look at the year-over-year delta between the percent of base on unsubsidized pricing that started to narrow and that will continue to narrow as we head into next year.\\n\\nThe other case and you’ve mentioned it was in the third quarter, we saw a sequential service revenue increase for the first time in three years. And the couple of side to that equation, if you think about the P times Q. We continue to add accounts ever since we launched unlimited, so when the base is increasing. And then we also saw in the third quarter sequentially offer increase as well. And so when the rate increases and the volume increases, you get to the service revenue growth. So, we look forward to delivering on that in ’18.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nIf we could -- just the ARPU issue, one of the things you said is, you've reached the point where each customer choosing the unlimited plan is now accretive. You talk about, versus, I think, at the beginning, the early switchers is more dilutive to ARPU. Could you talk about that dynamic? And what is that mean for sort of postpaid ARPU trends?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So what we do when the price plan changes, we look at the existing base and look at how their current plan they're all on compares to the new plan and which customers have the opportunity to migrate up and which ones are going to migrate down. And we do a lot of detailed math there, in addition to calculating what impact we think it will have in the market in terms of helping us add gross adds. And so we do that detailed math before any major price change. We certainly did it before we went to unlimited. So what you saw was, as soon as we launched unlimited, a lot of the migrators were the people who were paying a high price for a large data bucket and they could step down to unlimited.\\nAnd so those people moved really quickly. A large number of those in the last 6, 7 weeks of the first quarter and even into the start of the second quarter. The people who are going to step up to unlimited, they may not want to pay $20 a month more for an extra 4 gigs, but they'll pay $20 a month more to move from whatever bucket they're on to unlimited. That happens a lot more easily. And so what we saw is, by the end of the second quarter, we had reached that inflection point, where the people who were stepping up were more than offsetting the people that were are stepping down. And so for the third quarter, we saw migrators were a positive contributor to the ARPA story, and that should continue here as we go forward because -- so the people who are motivated to step down pretty much did that almost immediately.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nDoes it accelerate? I mean, I would imagine the people stepping down would be slowing and the ones stepping up?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, it does. To the extent that you’ve worked through the step downs, there’s not as many of left, of those left, of those left to go. There’s still some out there. So we still got some of that, but I do think it continues to be now a tailwind for the ARPU story rather than the headwind it was initially, but that was all part of the consideration when we launched that. It was not a surprise until we see that with every time we do a major price plan launch, if you give somebody the chance to save money and get something more a lot of them are pretty quick to do that.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGot you and then just finishing up with the unlimited. You have two unlimited plans out there. Can you talk about which one is seeing sort of greater adoption and the change in usage you’ve seen on the back of the move to unlimited for a user that previously had a bucket plan and now has unlimited plan?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, so the reason we went to the two different plans on unlimited is we’ve said, ever since we’ve been in the business. We don’t think there’s a one size fits all plan out there. Different users have different needs. And so for those customers, who like the idea of being on unlimited, they didn’t have to worry about the risk of overages or whatever, but aren’t massive video users whatever we created the Go Unlimited plan. And that has one level of network service. And in for those customers who wants to be unlimited and heavier video users wanted a different level of service, we created a beyond unlimited plan and we've seen good adoption of both plans since we launched them.\\n\\nSo that’s being pretty much as we expect kind of we know the base pretty well. We see the different usage paths out there. In terms of the overall usage certainly once we move to unlimited, we have seen increased usage on the network as expected, but really it's not at the peak times of the day. What we have seen is now the people no longer have the bucket, the data they are worried about, you see usage spread more through the day. And so, you are using the network more times when you are provisioning that network, but it wasn’t getting used as much. So, we are happy with the results we've seen so far. The network performance since we have launched unlimited has been fantastic and I think we've seen that in some of the third party results most recently with RootMetrics yet gain.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nSince you brought up the network and the network performance, maybe we can talk about sort of the densification efforts and your spectrum position, whether you need more spectrum. You obviously just are in the process of closing the deal for more millimeter wave spectrum, but I get asked a lot of questions about sort of more mid-band and low-band spectrum. So if you could address those 2 issues, please.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, we've gotten that question for a while. So look, as you think about spectrum, really the question should be around capacity because what we are doing is we are building capacity in the network. So think about the LTE network. Initially, it was a case of building a coverage layer, and we completed that in 2013, 2014. And ever since then, it's been around added capacity. And so there's different ways that you get to add capacity. Spectrum is one of those. And look, we're very happy with the spectrum position we have. Still only a little over 50% of our spectrum portfolio is supporting the LTE network, so there's significant capacity there, whether that's the AWS-3 spectrum that we bought two, three years ago, but only this year, we started to see devices come to market that have that band in it.\\nSo as we start to get enough of handsets in the base with that band, we'll start to see the benefit of owning that spectrum, but we don't have that yet. That benefit will kick in next year. We're re-farming PCS spectrum. As usage goes down on 3G, we get to move more of that spectrum across. And then, of course, as we get into next year, we'll get into unlicensed spectrum, too. So, look, there's lots of spectrum out there to support LTE, but spectrum's not the only way to add capacity. There's also technology and architecture. On the technology side, you've got all the advances on the LTE network that we've seen over the past couple of years, whether that be carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and some of the other technologies there that are improving the throughput, improving the speeds and also improving the cost efficiencies to operate that network.\\nSo the technology piece is there. It's not the same LTE network it was when we launched it a few years ago. And then from the architecture standpoint, this is where you get the densification, and we continue to densify. One of the ways we like to talk about adding capacity through densification rather than spectrum is -- look, you take right here in New York City as an example. If I'm going to add capacity with spectrum, that spectrum I buy covers a large geographic area. If I want to add capacity in Times Square through spectrum, yes, I'm getting spectrum that covers Times Square, but it's covering a lot of other places that may not need it. Whereas, if I go and use densification and small cells, I can put them where the usage is, but also, the areas where I don't need additional usage, I'm not creating capacity that ultimately is going to go wasted.\\n\\nSo we think that's a more efficient build. And as we mentioned on the slide we released last week, when you take the combination of the technology changes and benefits that we're seeing and the architecture with the densification, that's been like an 80% to 100% increase in capacity. So as I say, when -- you're really asking about how you increase capacity, and spectrum is just one of the three major levers we have.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nSo maybe on the densification, how far are you -- what inning are we in, in terms of the densification? It's a strategy we've been hearing from Verizon for a little bit. Maybe if you want to use New York as an example or sort of more broadly. And how long will it take to play out? And does it affect the overall cost structure of the wireless business from a sort of OpEx standpoint or CapEx standpoint?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So I think the densification will continue to be an ongoing exercise. We've certainly done a good amount of it already. The important thing about densification is it's built off of the fiber network that we're building out, and that's a multiuse fiber network. So we are densifying the 4G network. It's well under way in a number of cities across the country, including here in New York. I think it's had a very positive effect on the network. There will continue to be opportunities to densify the network further if usage increases. But the great thing is, as we do that, we get to use those same assets that supports other parts of our business. So as we showed last week, a lot of the sites that we've densified for 4G will be the same locations that we put 5G in.\\nAnd so when you put that 5G radio in, it's going to be using an existing infrastructure. And then even if you think about other parts of our business, whether it be as we build out smart city applications, enterprises and business customers, so today, I may be going by -- I may be in a building for an enterprise customer, I'm paying third-party access, if I put fiber down the street to put in small cells, I can also go into that building, use that same fiber network and reduce the cost there. So it's a change in our network architecture, but it's a case of building out a multiuse fiber network with then being out to sweat that in many different ways. And so the cost structure will evolve a little bit, but we think we can continue to produce very strong returns on that.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nAnd your appetite for additional spectrum, you set up the 600 megahertz auction. It looks like there's a 3.5 gigahertz auction coming, maybe 500 that are -- actually we see you're working on 5 gigahertz. How do you expect your sort of needs to evolve over time?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. Well, we like spectrum, but what I think you're seeing is a case of -- it's economics. Is it -- what's the right way to be able to add capacity? And we went through this in the AWS-3 auction. In a number of places around the country, it was economic to add capacity buying that spectrum. But there was a few locations where the prices went beyond that point, and we said, okay, we can densify better. But look, we are -- we've bought spectrum every year in the secondary markets. We continue to do so where it makes economic sense to add capacity the right way.\\nSo looking -- we'll look at future auctions. We're certainly excited about additional spectrum coming to market, but it has to meet the needs of the network. Obviously, the millimeter wave is something we've been very interested in lately as we think about developing 5G, and it has, to us, superior economic value. If it's spectrum that meets the needs of building out our network and we can acquire it at a reasonable price, we'll certainly participate.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nAnd you would think that the higher spectrum, say 3.5 or 5, would particularly suit this sort of small cell or sort of denser network fabrics that you guys are talking about?\\n\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, absolutely.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nMaybe just a quick chat about the competition in sort of traditional wireless. What are you seeing in the market today? And maybe how does it look like -- sort of the holiday selling season shaping up?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. I think it's certainly a very competitive marketplace. But what we've seen since mid-February when we launched unlimited was once we have a comparable offer in the marketplace, and you didn't have customers having to try to figure out, Okay, Verizon's got these buckets, and some of the other guys are on unlimited. How do I compare the prices of the two? Once we took that noise out of the system for customers, we've competed very well, and that's with the premium and the pricing that reflects the quality of the network and the overall service. And in addition to competing well in terms of gross adds, I think what's been the most rewarding has been what we've seen from our base of customers, and the phone churn we've seen over the past couple of quarters has been very strong.\\nWe have what we consider, by far, the best base of customers in the industry, and we're incredibly focused on keeping them. And I think we've done an excellent job of that this year. So as you look at the holiday season there's different offers out there in the marketplace. I will tell you we're competing effectively. But, look, we've got four weeks left. They're kind of important four weeks of the quarter, so we'll see how they play out. But so far this year, it's been -- I think the team has shown, once we put a comparable offer in the marketplace, we'll be in good position. And then when you think about fourth quarter from a year-over-year standpoint and kind of the overall results, obviously, as we've moved to unsubsidized pricing, the impact of the fourth quarter compared to other quarters of the year isn't as great because you don't have that massive subsidy cost on those holiday volumes.\\nBut when you do get those high volumes, you do still have some additional costs around commissions and whatnot. So you do -- you still see a bit of a step down in the margins in fourth quarter versus the rest of the year but nowhere near as significant as it was in previous years. And then last year, we had a lot of handset promotions out there. We were still on metered plans. The competition had moved to unlimited. And we used handsets to have a competitive offering in the marketplace, and that certainly had an impact on financials last year. The promos' this year have been -- have not been as focused that way. So we'll see how the quarter plays out, but I look forward to reporting on it when we get into January.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nNow as you think -- I mean a lot of those variables that you're discussing are sort of intertwined. You're seeing record-low churn, processing much lower upgrades than we had seen in previous fourth quarters. And maybe that has to do with the timing of maybe as it moves -- the move to unsubsidized pricing. But also, does the availability of the iPhone X or the upgrade cycle have anything to do with it as well? I'm basically trying to get to a point where -- what's driving that low churn? And can churn stay this low as the iPhone availability increase?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. Look, I would say there's two separate things in there, right? There's churn, and then there's upgrade. So as I look at the upgrade, right, certainly, as the difference from one device to the next isn't as significant as it was five to six years ago, and then the move to device payment, I think, has altered the upgrade rate. But we'll see where fourth quarter comes out. I'm not going to comment on it compared to the prior year or whatever at this point. It's too early in the holiday season.\\n\\nBut I think churn is as much a factor of the quality of the service we continue to provide as it is a lower upgrade rate. I think when you looked at customers who are on our network, understand the quality of the service that comes from that network. And so I think we have continued to do excellently there, and we continue to have the right offers for those customers. When we have the right offer in the marketplace, as we've had since mid-February this year, and you have the network performing as it does, I think the churn number is -- continues to be very sustainable.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGreat. And what about -- lastly, sort of on the wireless fundamentals. What about margins? Obviously, you've seen a dramatic increase in wireless margins over the last five years despite the fact that it -- that competitive intensity has increased. Just for fourth quarter guidance and as you look out over the next couple of years, do you expect to see that trend continue?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, absolutely. I mean, we're obviously seeing -- we're not going to get into forecasting exactly what the margins are going to be, but there's no reason to believe that, that's not the case. Look, you have to continue to have solid margins in this industry because when you have the needs on the network increasing year-over-year as they do, you have to generate solid cash flows to reinvest in the network, to add capacity so you can continue to meet customers' needs. It's not a case of you build the network and then you can leave it alone.\\nSo those margins are incredibly important to the long-term sustainability of the business, and we're here for the long haul. So I absolutely think there's -- we'll continue to have a strong margin profile, which will lead to a strong cash flow profile, which will allow us to reinvest in the business while producing returns for everyone. And then that's really why we're doing the cost program that Lowell announced a couple of months ago, is to make sure that we don't have any inefficiencies in the business that we need to take out and to push, make sure we have the maximum returns we can so we can continue to reinvest in the business in the way we have.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nLastly on the competitive intensity. Comcast launched their MVNO last year. Charter launched sort of midyear this year. Could you talk about how that's impacting the competitive landscape? And then do you still feel that, that's a contract that if you can do it all over again, you would and you're happy with the returns that you're getting from that from the wholesale standpoint?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. Look, that contract -- Lowell and others have said and I'll say exactly the same thing, when you look at that contract in its entirety, absolutely, you go ahead and do that again. We think it's a great contract. We've been in the wholesale business for over 20 years now, and we think the returns, from our standpoint on that, have been pretty good. It allows us to use the network more than we otherwise would if we just operate with our own customer base. It produces -- increases the return on that investment. Look, they're going to come in. They're going to do some things differently, some other wholesalers. We look forward to seeing what they do, but I think we've competed very effectively against all the various wholesale partners that we've seen over the past couple of decades and see no reason why we won't continue to do so.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGot you. I would say one of the bigger initiatives at Verizon these days is the 5G plans. You guys had some announcements last week on the back of the 11 test markets that you've had up and running for some time now. Can you just walk us through what you would say are the sort of biggest learnings from the test markets that you've had up and running?\\n\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So last week, we announced that we would be doing an initial commercial launch of 5G residential broadband in three to five cities around the country in the second half of next year, with Sacramento being the first of those, with the others to be named as we go forward. And as you said, it's really built off of having seen the results of these 11 test markets we've been in since the spring. And so as we think about 5G residential broadband product, it's using millimeter wave spectrum. And that's a spectrum that we haven't used significantly in the past, and its operating characteristics are very different. And so we spent a lot of time in 2015 in the lab environment.\\nLast year, we took it outside in limited-use cases in real-world environments, and initially, we did kind of larger commercial-type tests. And those have exceeded our expectations in a number of key areas, the primary of those being the propagation of the spectrum. And the distance that we see that you can get over gigabit speeds, north of 2,000 feet, is part of the economics of the business case. And there was a lot of questions going into it, and I think there's still different people with different views in the larger ecosystem around the overall propagation.\\nBut we've run this in the real-world environment, in different topographies, and we proved that you don't need direct line of sight. We've proved that you can get to at least 20 floors on MDUs, not just five or six floors. And so the addressable market here is a pretty good size. Outside of our Fios-served markets, we see approximately 30 million homes that, based off the results of this test, are addressable by this residential broadband product. So we'll start on that next year in those three to five cities, and then we'll continue to roll from there.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nAnd that 30 million number, I mean, one, I guess, how soon do you contemplate getting to those or reaching those from a home passed standpoint, the 30 million? Then how do you get to that number? And could it -- as the business model sort of proves itself out, could that go up or go down? Or is that a number that's in flux? Or how strongly do you feel about that 30 million?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So that 30 million is based off the results we've seen so far. So you look at it based off of, okay -- based off how far it propagates in the topography in different areas and the mix of MDUs and SFUs in each area, okay, how many places have the type of population density profile that's going to provide a return? You can get whatever number of homes you need per node based off of the test results, and that's really behind the math. So it will be over the course of the next short number of years that we build out all those different locations.\\nAnd then, as we've seen with other products, you build up to your penetration levels over some period of time, but certainly think it just starts to be significant to our financials in the next two to three years. Beyond that, in terms of can that 30 million grow or whatever, what we have typically seen as we've deployed technologies over time is that we find benefits versus our original use case and the performance continues to ratchet up rather than the other way around. So we'll see how it plays in 5G here, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see that same thing over time.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGot you. And the services that you'll be selling, I remember, from the event last week, you talked about sort of the triple play, where we had assumed it would be more of sort of just a broadband-only service. So maybe talk about your thoughts on providing a video service and what kind of form that could -- what that could look like.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So our thinking on that, as you said, we're going to offer broadband only. But if customers want video as well, certainly, and there'll be a voice component, too. Look, if you're going to go into somebody's home, and let's say you have a triple play today, and we come by and say, John, we've got a new service. It's got better broadband than your current provider, but we don't have the video offering, that's probably not as -- you'd say,\\n\\nOkay, well, I'm going to keep the video with my current guy, but I'm going to move the broadband across. And is that going to be an attractive proposition? So for those people who have -- the cord-cutters who have moved off of getting linear TV, then we'll do broadband only. But for those people who continue to want to bundle their video with their broadband, we'll have that. Now how we deliver it, it won't be your traditional linear TV product. It'll be a more over-the-top product, and the exact nature of that OTT product is -- more details to come there.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGot you. And then maybe from a go-to-market standpoint, do you anticipate -- can you talk a little bit about being an insurgent? Does that imply that your pricing will be more aggressive than what you're seeing in the sort of traditional broadband market? And do you expect to target existing wireless customers that are comfortable with the Verizon product and services?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. No, that's a good point. Look, we're not going to announce our price plans at this point, but certainly, when you don't have an existing base yet, that's one thing. But remember, when you go into these markets -- as we go into these markets, we're not going in without knowing the customers in those markets. We have a lot of customer relationships, over 100 million connections in our wireless network, so we know a number of those people already. A number of those people we'll be targeting are already Verizon customers, and so we will look to add a 5G product to our relationship with them.\\nAnd the other important thing about the 5G development is this is the first use case for the 5G network, but it's not a single use case network where it's just about doing residential broadband. This is the top of the first inning on 5G. And as we move from there and you get into mobility use cases that will follow soon after and whether those be mobility use cases for consumers or an area that's really exciting, it's actually more as you think about IoT and all the different things with the lower latencies, with the higher throughputs and so on, there will be many more applications for 5G, things that you can't do in 4G. So we're very excited to get to those mobility use cases as well.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGreat. Maybe shifting gears over to the wireline space. Maybe, first of all, let's talk about the business market. How attractive is the enterprise market, would you say, to Verizon? And does the CenturyLink-Level 3 deal help rationalize things at all in that segment?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So, the wireline enterprise business continues to be very competitive. I think when you look at our wireline businesses in general, whether it be enterprise or small business or consumer, you really have to break it between the copper businesses and the fiber businesses. And certainly, the copper-based businesses are going to continue to see a level of secular decline. I mean, there's just functionality that you can't deliver over the old copper network. The costs on that network are different, and so that decline will continue. Where we're optimistic is the things we're doing on the fiber networks. And especially as you think about managed services, the large enterprises and the things we're doing in SDN and security and some other things, I think we're -- we see opportunities in enterprise to be -- for that to continue to be significant to us.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGot you. And you mentioned the SMB market. I mean, it seems like the trends there continue to worsen. I mean, is that a function of competition from cable or the lack of fiber penetration in that base? Or how do you see that trending?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So, again, it comes back to the difference in the networks. Look, when you're competing with a co-ax product -- a 2017 co-ax product with copper only, you're not well positioned for that -- to compete in that marketplace. Where we have Fios, we compete very effectively in that marketplace. And so as you think about densifying the wireless network, and you have fiber going out in all these places and you're going past a lot of these SMB businesses, there's opportunities there for us to be effective in that marketplace. So again, it's really a case of break that wireline business between copper and fiber. And the fiber side of it, we continue to compete very effectively.\\n\\nJohn Hodulik\\nYou mentioned Fios. I think at this point, after the sale, you have about 14 million Fios homes passed, a new competitor in a portion of that market with Altice. How do the trends look? Has Altice proven to be a more aggressive competitor than, say, Cablevision was? And does their plans to upgrade to fiber-to-the-home sort of change the outlook for you over the next few years? Would that...\\nMatthew Ellis\\nNo, not all. I think, look, first of all, their plans to do the fiber-to-the-home, I think, validates what we've been doing for over 10 years now with Fios and the value that brings and the things you can do with fiber-to-the-home that other technologies can't match. So we look at that. You said a new competitor to the market. It's really a change in competitor in that market, right? And, look, we've seen change in ownership in multiple markets over the past few years that we have Fios, and we see a change in how the new owner wants to approach that market.\\nBut I think we continue to operate successfully across the full footprint, whether that's here in the greater New York City area or up and down the coast from Boston to D.C. So, Fios continues to be a very good product, continues to resonate very strongly in the marketplace, especially on the broadband side. I mean, just think about if you're moving -- if you're cutting the cable -- cutting the cord on your TV subscription and you're going to rely on your video entertainment through over-the-top, you want the best broadband experience you can get, and Fios is the best broadband experience in the marketplace.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nMaybe talk about some of the new initiatives. Obviously, you've completed the Yahoo! transaction, and you're now in the -- maybe update us on the process of consolidating those two entities under Oath. And maybe talk about how those assets are performing and where that fits into the Verizon asset base.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So that integration is going well. I think we're -- this is week 25. So a large part of the integration is really taking those platforms and consolidating them together. So a lot of good work has gone on so far around the cost side of the business and getting the cost efficiencies that were obviously there when you take those two businesses and put them together. The team's on track with those things. And then when we get the platforms integrated together and really going forward with one set of products rather than continue to offer the two sets that we still have today, that's the point at which we'll have the opportunity to see not just a cost benefit but the top line benefit, too, which is important to get to the overall goals that you've heard Tim and others talk about by 2020. So that integration is going well, continuing to see some strong usage on those platforms. Having over 1 billion monthly active users gives us opportunities to compete in that space and be very relevant when you think about bringing more digital video across as well. So happy with what we've seen so far. The team's still got a bunch of work to do, but they're on track.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nDo you feel that with Yahoo! you have all the piece parts you need or the assets you need to accomplish your goals in that segment?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So what time frame are you saying there?\\nJohn Hodulik\\n36 months.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. Look, I think we're very happy with the combination of those assets. We've got some good technology in place there, some good platforms there. Now you also -- with the closing of the Yahoo! deal, you bring the eyeballs to that as well, so there's a lot there. But I think when you say, do you have the right set of assets? that's a question that -- look, over years, any business continues to evolve and, I think ours has as well. I think we have a great track record not just of looking to acquire businesses to help us move forward, but also to divest the businesses that no longer are core and using that as we continue to update the portfolio.\\n\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGot you. Earlier in our talk here, you talked about the $10 billion cost-savings initiative over the next four years. Can give us a little bit more color on that? I mean, can you separate it? I believe it's a mix of CapEx and OpEx. And then maybe within the OpEx piece, if there's any specific buckets you guys hope to tackle.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So what we're saying is we will take out cash outflows that are in the business today, whether they be CapEx or OpEx, in the cumulative $10 billion over the next four years. So as you just think of the balance of those cash outflows in CapEx and OpEx, obviously, the majority is OpEx. So that will be where the biggest piece is, and every area is in focus. Obviously, network costs is likely to be a large part of that, and a number of things that Hans Vestberg has started working on is going to help contribute to that. I mean, it's really continue to evolve how we build the network for the future versus how we build networks in the past and making sure that we're able to run those more efficiently than our competition.\\nSo network could be a huge part of it. Distribution and care, obviously, are areas we're always focused on, and we'll take a fresh look at those and we'll find opportunities there. And that will contribute. And then even -- all the way down to all the different G&A functions, we'll take a close look at and make sure that we are running the business as efficiently as we can be so that what -- we take as much of the revenue to the bottom line, to the cash flow line and be able to reinvest it in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and continue to increase the dividend. We did that for the 11th straight year a couple of months ago, and we look forward to putting the board in a position where they can continue to do that.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nSo when we look at those $10 billion cost savings over the next four years, should we expect them to sort of come at a sort of linear rate? Or is it -- are they more back-end loaded?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nI think we'll step into them in '18, we'll get the initial round. And then by the end of '18, we'll be, I would say, fully up to speed. And so we'll generate more in '19 than we do in '18, and then we'll see how the last couple of years play out there. But in general, I think you should not expect, obviously, the biggest parts to be in '18, but as we get into next year, we'll update everyone on the progress.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGot you. And is the plan designed to sort of offset the spending on both OpEx and CapEx you expect on -- with the 5G initiative? Or how are those relative to each other in size?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nNo, I actually see them in isolation. We just have the obligation to periodically look at the cost base of the business and make sure that we're being as efficient as we can. So that's one piece. As I think about 5G, that's a different activity. But as you think about the cost to build that out, there are two things I would say. One is we -- I think we have a pretty good track record of changing the focus of our CapEx while keeping the overall level very -- the level of capital intensity very consistent year-over-year. But what that's on may change.\\nSo we've moved from 3G, then we moved the focus on Fios and then we moved the focus on LTE and then we moved to 5G. So those two things really, really aren't linked significantly there. The other thing I would say about 5G is, unlike when we built 4G, which was building out a new network, 5G is a complementary network to 4G. It's not replacing 4G. So from a total network standpoint, it's complementary, and then the underlying assets, this gets back to the building out a multiuse fiber platform, you're going to use a lot of that same fiber infrastructure to deploy 5G, so it will be a very different deployment from a cost standpoint.\\n\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGot you. And maybe just to finish up, you mentioned earlier, as we look at some of your uses of cash, it looks like we're going to get some form of tax reform over -- relatively soon. I guess it depends on when it actually kicks in, but sort of what's your outlook? What does it mean for the company? And what would you do with potential excess cash coming out of tax reform?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. Look, we've been -- we've stated our support for tax reform and the need for it over the past few years and certainly believe the U.S. economy needs it for the corporations to be competitive when you look at alternative tax rates across the world. Glad that both chambers have passed versions of the bill, but they haven't obviously got those reconciled into one bill yet. So in terms of what that benefit may or may not be, we'll wait to see what they do. But certainly, we look forward to them doing that.\\nLook, overall, I would say, as you think about the cash flow of the business, it's driven by the execution on the fundamentals, and that's something we've done well in 2017. We'll continue in 2018. That allows us to invest in continuing to build out the network capabilities that we have that lead the industry. That allows us to have a great base of customers that I think we've done a great job working with and we'll continue to do so, to build out new ecosystems and then, ultimately, produce returns to shareholders. So I think we've done a good job on that this year, and we look forward to doing more of the same next year.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGreat. Matt, that's all we have time for. Thanks for joining us.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThank you. Thank you, John.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nEnd of Q&A\", '/article/4114751-verizon-communications-vz-q3-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript': \"Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 19, 2017  8:30 AM ET\\nExecutives\\nMichael Stefanski - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\\nMatthew Ellis - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\nBrady Connor - Head of Investor Relations\\nAnalysts\\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley\\nJohn Hodulik - UBS\\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs\\nDavid Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\\nMichael Rollins - Citigroup\\nCraig Moffett - MoffettNathanson\\nMichael McCormack - Jefferies\\nJennifer Fritzsch - Wells Fargo\\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays\\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer\\nOperator\\nGood morning, and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nThanks, Eunice. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I’m here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brady Connor, who will be assuming my role as the Head of Investor Relations later in the fourth quarter.\\nAs a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.\\nBefore I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon’s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.\\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.\\nBefore Matt goes through the results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of about $620 million, primarily associated with early debt redemption costs of $454 million and acquisition and integration related charges of $166 million retaining to Yahoo and other acquisitions.\\nThe net impact of these items after tax was approximately $374 million, or $0.09 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.98 in the third quarter, compared to $1.01 a year ago. Included in our EPS is a $0.01 impact due to the natural disasters in Texas and Florida during the quarter.\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. Let me by start by reviewing the progress on our strategic initiatives before getting into detailed results. The cornerstone of our strategy is to provide our customers with the best network experience available. We are steadily investing to advance our 4G LTE leadership and actively building the network of the future.\\nOur network performance leadership was evidenced by a sweep of third-party surveys for the first half of 2017 and a network's resiliency during the recent hurricanes and wildfires. We delivered solid operational and financial performance in a competitive environment. We grew our retail postpaid and prepaid wireless bases with new unlimited data options and maintain strong customer retention.\\n\\nService revenue trajectory also improved as expected. Our wireline results were consistent with the past quarters despite ongoing consumer video headwinds throughout the industry. Demand for a high quality fiber based products remains strong. Our Oath team's integration of AOL and Yahoo is ahead of our internal expectation.\\nWe are confident in the execution of our strategy to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows and produce long-term value for our shareholders. The board of directors demonstrated our commitment to return value to our shareholders when they declared the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase last month.\\nWe will start by reviewing the third quarter segment operation performance, followed by a progress update on our new businesses, a walkthrough of consolidated results and finally network and technology updates.\\nNow onto the wireless segment on Slide 5. Our wireless business delivered another strong quarter of operational performance in a highly competitive environment. We grew and retained high value postpaid customer relationships profitably. In August, we expanded our postpaid unlimited data plan to include a lower price access entry points, which provides consumers with more choices to experience the leading 4G LTE network with confidence in our networks we are now addressing a larger market with Unlimited.\\nGiven our clear and comparable service value proposition, momentum continued in the quarter. Smartphone net adds were 486,000 versus 242,000 last year. Total postpaid net additions were 603,000 included [four] (Ph) net adds of 274,000, 91,000 tablets and 238,000 other connected devices led by wearables. We added 30,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 107,000 last year.\\nTotal retail postpaid churn was 0.97% for the third quarter which improved by seven basis points year-over-year. postpaid's phone churn was 0.75% and was the main driver of the improvement in total postpaid churn. Postpaid device activations were nearly 9.8 million of which 82% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rates was 5.5%.\\nDuring the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid net adds were 139,000 for the quarter with an increased focus on the smartphone value proposition. Additionally, we have recently expanded our offering to allow families the flexibility to combine different prepaid plans at a great value.\\nLet's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 2.4% in third quarter as compared to a 3.9% decline a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, service revenue declined 5.1% versus a 6.7% decrease in the previous quarter. sequentially service revenue increased for the first time in 12 quarters.\\nThe key drivers of overall improvement in service revenue include increased access revenue through customer migration to higher access points. New account formation and the tail end of the transition of customers to unsubsidized pricing. We now have approximately 78% of the postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans as compared to 60% a year ago. We expect the service revenue trends to continue to improve in the fourth quarter and to exit the year with a decline of less than 4% year-over-year.\\nIn the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 5.5% due to a higher device payment plan take rate. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, which is consistent with the prior period. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth third quarter to increase seasonally due to heightened consumer equipment activity.\\nApproximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance at the end of the quarter. Wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.2%, up slightly sequentially and up from 44.9% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, we expect the improvement in service revenue to flow through wireless EBITDA margin partially offsetting pressures in highest seasonal volume, advertising expenses and promotional activity.\\n\\nLet’s move next to our wireline segment on Slide 7. Total reported wireline revenue grew 1.1% including XO operations and data center divestitures. On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.7%, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Our fiber offerings continue to gain share and grow revenue partially offset in a decline in legacy copper products.\\nConsumer markets revenue increased 0.9% driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue grew 4.6% including the impacted two markey Pay Per View events during the quarter. Verizon was recognized by a leading third-party study as the top rated residential internet provider for customer satisfaction in the Fios footprint.\\nFios Gigabit Connection, which launched earlier this year continues to gain traction offers symmetrical speed of up to one gigabit per second. We added 66,000 Fios Internet Customers in the quarter. Fios Video results were pressured due to the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings, as well as competitive promotional activity. Fios Video losses were 18,000 in the quarter.\\nEnterprise Solutions revenue excluding XO, decreased 5.0%, while growth in fiber based products continues. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 5.3%. Partner Solutions revenue declined 3.9% on an organic basis, which is an improvement over prior period. Within business markets, fiber revenue is increasing, driven by demand for Fios broadband products.\\nOn an organic basis, total revenue declined 5.8% year-over-year. On a comparable basis, the third quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 21.1%, compared to 20.3% a year ago and up 40 basis points sequentially driven by ongoing costs control measures.\\nLet’s move next to Slide 8 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. During the quarter, our Oath team has been executing on more than 20 integration work streams. We are positioning the business for the future, locking in early synergies and setting out a roadmap for the next several years with the expectations to realize $1 billion in operating expense synergies through 2020.\\nWith the addition of Oath, Verizon's addressable market has expanded from millions of wireless and wireline customers to about one billion global content consumers. We are combining the best aspects of AOL and Yahoo to create a uniform and integrated platform to drive engagement and consumer value.\\nOath revenue is $2 billion for the quarter, we will provide additional information on Oath in future quarters as we progress through the integration phase. Telematics revenue was over $220 million in the quarter including Fleetmatics and Telogis. Total IoT revenue on an organic basis increased approximately 13% in the quarter.\\nLet's move next to Slide 9 to wrap up with our consolidated results for the quarter. The solid segment results in the quarter and addition of new businesses drove improvements in the consolidated top-line reported results. In the third quarter, total operating revenues were higher by 2.5% on a reported basis. On a comparable basis, excluding divestures and acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined to 2.3%.\\nSimilar to recent quarters, the primary driver was the year-over-year decrease in wireless service revenue. On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margins was 36.7% up slightly from prior year's margin of 36.5%. We are focused on driving profitability through cost and capital efficiencies across our business. As Lowell announced in September, we have targeted $10 billion in cumulative cash savings over the next four years.\\nLet's turn now to cash flows in the balance sheet on the Slide 10. We had a strong quarter of cash generation supporting our consistent capital allocation program and returning value to shareholders. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $17.2 billion including working capital pressure primarily due to the $3.7 billion of device payment plan receivables.\\n\\nYear-to-date capital expenditures were $11.3 billion with the sequential with a sequential increases in the quarter driven by increased spending in wireless, supporting growing network demand, while prepositioning for 5G. We expect full-year 2017 capital expenditures to be at the lower end of the guided range of $16.8 billion to $17.5 billion.\\nFree cash flow from the first nine months of the year totaled $5.9 billion, which included a net after tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion. In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset backed securitization which we initiated in the third quarter of last year.\\nwe did not executing an asset back securitization during the third quarter, but have generated $2.9 billion year-to-date from our ABS borrowings. Over the last few days, we completed our third public ABS transaction this year to $1.4 billion.\\nThe impact of device payment plans and on balance sheet securitization is expected to approach a steady state by year-end, reducing working capital headwinds during 2018. We anticipate working capital fluctuations throughout the year due to seasonality in wireless equipment volumes.\\nWe ended the quarter with the $117.5 billion of total debt, comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Our near term unsecured maturities are modest at $2.3 billion through 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business.\\nLet’s move next to Slide 11 to discuss our network and technology. Our industry leading wireless and wireline networks are the cornerstone of our strategy and we consistently invest to ensure that we have capacity to serve growing demand technology to reduce the cost of serve and a network position to lead the industry into the future. We continue to win awards in third-party studies, a test to combination of coverage, speed and reliability.\\nBased on the confidence in our network, we broaden to unlimited options to offer more customers and unmatched unlimited experience on the best wireless network. As expected, the introduction of unlimited pricing plans has increased the LTE network usage across various busy timeframes and geographies as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day.\\nWe are more affectively utilizing existing network capabilities and service plan features to handle the increased traffic without interrupt in the quality of the customer experience. Just over 50% of our available low and mid-band spectrum portfolio is being used 4G LTE.\\nNetwork reliability and resiliency are critical elements to our wireless network, we are thankful and proud of the work performed by our employees during the tragic natural disasters in Texas, Florida and Northern California, who ensured they are first responder and all of those effect who were able to relay on our network in the time of need. We maintained a high level of performance through our planning, network redundancy and rapid response despite wide spread power outages.\\nAlthough, we are not a wireless network operate in Puerto Rico, we have offered assistance to the local carriers and government officials as they work to recover from unprecedented hurricane damage. We are steadily investing in the network of the future, which we called a Verizon Intelligent Edge Network.\\nThis network has many components the lead to a multi-use software driven network upscale. It goes from the wireless or wireline access networks to intelligent distributed computing platform to a highly automated software enabled core network. This architecture enable by a dense flexible radio network with deep multi-used fiber that we have been building for years.\\n\\nAs we seen new use cases, this Intelligent Edge Network architecture will meet the new types of application demand. We will leverage these in [HART] (Ph) network capability such as latency, throughput and security to create network slices that will be tuned to the specific needs of each application.\\nOur pre-commercial 5G fixed wireless broadband trials are continuing, live customer experiences on the network provide key data and learnings that will give us valuable insights for commercial deployments. We are on-track to share trial results later in the fourth quarter. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G industry standards and the ecosystems are fixed in mobile. Global development is accelerating based on our work alongside industry partners for multiple used cases.\\nLet’s move next to Slide 12 to review our strategy for future growth. We are confident in our strategy to drive future growth while delivering near-term results. We are laying the foundation for the network of the future, while maintaining a strong lead in 4G LTE coverage, capacity and reliability. Our focus is on preserving and growing our customer relationships, while expanding our presence in digital media and Telematics.\\nThe execution model is to deliver strong fundamental results, allocate capital to our networks, maintain a strong balance sheet and return value to our shareholders. Our wireless value proposition is evolved to allow more customers to experience unlimited wireless plans on the best U.S. networks. We produce solid operational and financial performance across the business in a competitive environment while investing in our best-in-class networks and driving near-term cost efficiencies.\\nOur long-term strategy is to change people's lives by delivering the promise of the digital world while leading the industry and innovate for future technological application. 5G provides a path for growth with fixed and mobility use cases with 4G interoperability. The 5G ecosystem is progressing with [standards] (Ph) and technology development and we are prepositioning our network with fiber investments, spectrum resources and cloud architecture.\\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Mike so that we can get to your questions.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nThank you Matt. Eunice, we are now ready to take questions.\\nQuestion-And-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. We will now begin the Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\\nSimon Flannery\\nGreat, thank you very much. Good morning. Matt, you mentioned the $10 billion cost reduction program. Could you just give us a little bit more color around some of the buckets on that and how should that layer through the next four years. and then on Unlimited, any updated stats on what percent of your base or what percent of your new customers are taking that plan and obviously since you changed it to the two or the three plans who's taking the lower rate plan versus the higher is that splitting more towards the higher ARPU plans. Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks Simon and good morning. So on your first question around the $10 billion books, Lowell announced that last month, since then we have put a dedicated team against that and we are starting to get around that work. It's a little early to get into some of the specifics of the timing of when you should see that, but in terms of bucket that's going to come across.\\nReally think about all of the all parts of the business are in focus here, whether that’s the network, whether that be distribution and care and even to obviously the shared service parts of our business and across the complete supply chain.\\nWe are going to take a deep look across the whole business and identify areas where we have the opportunities to significantly improve the efficiency on how we operate the business. As we get further into that program, we will share more specifics overtime both on where the savings are going to be realized from and also the expected timing, but I think we are off to a good start with it.\\n\\nIn terms of your second question around Unlimited and the new price plans. I would tell you that between Unlimited and the Verizon 2.0 that we introduced last summer, we now have approximately two-thirds of the base on planned where they could control their over expense. And so that's up as you would expected from where we were a quarter ago and that's obviously a significant part of the base now has the ability to do that.\\nThe mix is as expected between the two plans, we are not going to go into the specifics of each of those. I would tell you though that in the third quarter what was - we saw as we expected the migration of existing customers from data bucket plans to Unlimited plans shifted to where on average they were stepping up in revenue from their bill prior.\\nAnd as we expected, we knew that initially we would see optimizes who had the opportunity to move to Unlimited and save money, we saw that in this first quarter as we introduced those plans. In the second quarter, we continue to move through that by the end of the quarter essentially that was flat that customer’s migrated over. And then in the third quarter, we got to the point where the customers migrating over actually increasing and you saw the increase in [indiscernible] sequentially from 2Q to 3Q for the first time in three years. So we are seeing good progress there.\\nSimon Flannery\\nGreat. Just one quick follow-up. Any impact then on 2018 or is it really going to be ramping through 2018, so the impact is more 2019, 2020 from the 10 billion.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYou will see some impact in 2018, but it’s a cumulative number over those four years, but absolutely, we will see benefit in 2018.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nSimon, thank you. Next question Eunice.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGreat. Matt, couple of questions on the wireless sort of the growth and profitability. First on the upgrade, saw a low number in the third quarter. As you guys look after the fourth quarter do you think that changes and maybe bounces back a little bit, like maybe won’t see as much seasonality you typically do, we are basically trying to get a sense whether it’s sort of a lack change in the technology or just customer at this point waiting for their turn to come out?\\nAnd then related to Simon’s questions, you saw sequential growth in service revenue for the first time in a while this quarter and it sounds like these trends are sort of inflecting. So could you guys return to sort of year-over-year growth sooner than the third quarter next year given those underlying trend you are seeing in ARPU? And related to your comments about margins, does that mean that we might not see the typical downdraft in margins, we typically do in the fourth quarter given the flow through effects that you mentioned?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, thanks John. So as you mentioned the upgrade rate in the third quarter was a little lower than we have seen in past years. I think what you are seeing there is difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we have historically seen. Obviously Apple is part of that with splitting the new devices between the eight, which came out in 3Q and the ten which comes out in 4Q.\\nBut also on the Android OS side of the house with having the new Google device coming out this month as well. I think you are going to see more of – we would expect to see a shift is some of the volumes versus typically from 3Q to 4Q. So look as we get into the holiday season some of those new devices come out, we think, we will see strong demand and look if you are paying a $1000 for a new handset you are going to walk not to be on a good network. So we are very confident that we will get more than our fair share of that activity when it comes through in the fourth quarter, but obviously, we will wait to see exactly how that plays out.\\n\\nIn terms of the sequential revenue trends and as you highlighted, we were up in service revenue from 2Q to 3Q. That was in-line with our expectations as we discussed on the last call. As you start to see combination a number of factors. We have largely migrated the consumer base to unsubsidized pricing, it was 78% in 3Q, 75% in 2Q. So that transition is largely done and so you are no longer seeing as much of a headwind from the reduction in the line access fee. And as I mentioned, we are starting to see step up and migrate is over.\\nIn addition to that, we increased the number of accounts for the second quarter in a row, so you got the total volume in the business up as the rate we are getting from customers going up too. So as I said in the script, we expect to be inside of 4% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, and as I have said previously, I expect that we will get to service revenue growth during 2018.\\nIn terms of your questions around margins, it's a little too soon to say where they will play out in the fourth quarter. Obviously as we are now on unsubsidized, we don't have the same subsidy headwind, but we will see what the environment is like in the fourth quarter competitively and we will respond as necessary. So we will see where that shakes out between now and the end of the year.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nGreat, thanks Matt.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nThanks John. Eunice, next question please?\\nOperator\\nThank you. Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\\nBrett Feldman\\nThanks for taking the question. I was hoping you can maybe unpack the improvement you continue to see in postpaid churn, particularly phone churn. You obviously have a much better visibility into your customer base and than we do. So for example, to what extend do you think that this is a structural improvement in churn as a result of customers moving into Unlimited plans and other plans where they can control their overage. To what extent do you think it might just be that the seasonal pattern of device launches has been moved a bit and so it could see it moved back to prior levels as we go through that cycle.\\nAnd then just as an extension of this question of this question. Some of your competitors have been looking to lower churn by including free or just deeply discounted streaming video products as part of their bundles. I'm curious whether that's something that you think would make sense for Verizon as well. Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks Brett. Look I would say as I look at the churn number, we have always had a good churn number, it's obviously 0.75 continues to trend that we saw in the second quarter and really continues the trend since we saw mid February when we launched Unlimited. And as we said at the time, the key driver of launching Unlimited was to protect our pace of customer which we think is the best and most valuable set of customers in the industry.\\nSo look there is a number of things that go into that, but I would tell one of the biggest thesis is the network experience that Verizon customers have, they get to see that they understand the reality of our network experience versus some of the others and so we saw that with some of the recent natural disasters that customers on our network understands that when things really matter Verizon is a network they want to be on. So that continues to be key part of it and I believe we can continue to have very good churn without necessarily the bundle in other aspect into the core offering.\\nBrett Feldman\\nIs it fair to say that you would expect on a seasonal basis going forward. So for example, this fourth quarter you still think you might do better than you did a year ago even if there is an uptick in devices and maybe industry wide churn.\\n\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYou mean to better year-over-year [indiscernible] number?\\nBrett Feldman\\nYes.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, I think look we have seen that since we launched Unlimited and we had a clear and comparable offer in the marketplace. We have demonstrated that our customers prefer being on Verizon rather than moving somewhere else and I have no reason to believe that will change in the fourth quarter as we go forward. So very confident that we will see that trend continue.\\nBrett Feldman\\nThanks for taking the questions.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nThanks Brett. Next question please?\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\\nDavid Barden\\nHey, guys. Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I guess just a couple. First, Matt, you kind of highlighted the impact of divestitures and acquisitions on the revenue line which was about a 5% swing versus the reported numbers. Could you maybe walk that down through EBITDA and then to earnings with respect to all the different moving parts year-over-year?\\nAnd then second, Lowell was pretty widely reported as talking about working on a content type of program or partnership or acquisition as you worked into the back part of the year. Could you elaborate a little bit more on kind of what the goal is for that project and maybe how it ties to your plans for launching your own over-the-top video products? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, so I will start with the second one there. So with respect to Lowell’s comment around content and potential deal for usage rights. I would say, we are continuing to work that particular transaction Lowell, when he made that common expected it would be done by now. Unfortunately it just taken a little longer to [indiscernible] fully expect to see something there as we move forward.\\nIn terms of the over the top, really nothing new to add versus what Lowell said last month. Look this is a space what we think there is an opportunity for us to play, we think that makes sense for us to play in that space, but we don’t want to launch just a me too type product. So we are continuing to look at what makes sense for us to launch something that’s differentiated in that space, probably around live programming, but how and when we launch something will be TBD.\\nIn terms of the, your questions around the M&A side. Obviously the revenue line, we brought Yahoo and you brought XO and those brought revenue on day one, when you close a transactions or same thing with the Telematics businesses as we closed in the back half of last year, but initially especially the Telematics businesses and Yahoo not significant.\\nThe EBITDA or EPS line maybe a little bit of pressure, the EPS line if anything about $0.04 on a year-to-date basis. And then they also bring depreciation and amortization, which is why there may not a huge amount of pressure at the EBITDA line, but as you move down the income statements of operating income and EPS, we see a little pressure this year. As we expand those businesses going forward we expect them to contribute in the future.\\nDavid Barden\\nGreat. Okay, thanks.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nEunice, next question please?\\nOperator\\nThank you. Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\\nMichael Rollins\\nWell thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the three to five year view for wireless. Can you just help us understand the Verizon’s expectations with the investments you are making, the technology that you are deploying? How investor should think about top-line growth over a more extended period of time?\\nAnd then secondly, if you could delve into a little bit more detail on some of the businesses you have acquired in over the last couple of years. In terms of Oath and Telamatics and how should investors think about the growth of those businesses over the next couple of years as well on the top-line especially? Thanks.\\n\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, thanks Mike. So look, as you think about the while this business going forward and obviously I’m going to talk specifically about our views on 2018 and so on. We will have those discussions when we get to January. But you think of the business overall, we are very confident with where seeing the growth start to migrate to we talked about the trends in service revenue, the fact that we should expect those to get back to positive during 2018 once we have worked through the transition fully from subsidized to unsubsidized pricing.\\nWe think it will continue from there, we will continue to add net adds to the business based of the quality of the network. And then the network will continue to expand the capabilities as we transition to 5G and we think that will give us other opportunities to expand the wireless business going forward.\\nSo we are very confident in the future trajectory of the business there and obviously as we think about three to five year view, the overall GDP is going to play into that. But as I think about 5G and what it’s going to do for the business going forward, and then as I think about the new businesses coming in, and contributing as we expand those and then continuing to work on the cost side of the business as Lowell described last month. I don't think that you're going to recognize the business five years from now versus where it is today.\\nMichael Rollins\\nIf I could just follow-up on that point, the wireline business is something where you upgraded significant amount to fiber, but you also have some copper, you're competing for a full - bundle in a lot of your market, but you're smaller relative to some of your video competitors. Have you thought about doing something different in the wireline business in terms of the way the footprint will look, whether it's through 5G or other investments in the wireline business or other strategic options for that assets.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, so there is a lot in that question Mike. So look fundamentally as you think about the wireline business you're thinking about really two assets there, you have got the legacy copper business which continues to have a secular declines across our set of customers, whether that the consumer, enterprise, small business whatever.\\nAnd then you have the fiber side of that business where we see continued growth and demand. And that's just not within the [indiscernible] footprint, its more international sales. So if you think around we have had the Ultra-Long-Haul backbone for a number of years now, earlier this year we expanded that with the XO acquisition which added fiber metro rings in the 45 of the top 50 markets. We obviously have significant fiber in the Northeast corridors, we have been building Fios over the last 10 years.\\nSo you should expect to see the fiber side of the wireline business continue to grow and become more relevant and then as part of that you have got the convergence of the network between the fiber network and the wireless network as we [indiscernible] 4G and preposition for 5G. So as we go forward here we think that the combination of those networks is incredibly important.\\nMichael Rollins\\nThank you.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nMike thank you. Next question please?\\nOperator\\nThank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\\nCraig Moffett\\nHi, thanks. First Mike, I just wanted to say congratulations on a terrific career in IR and thank you on perhaps all the help you have given us and Brady congratulations on your new position as well. I wanted to ask about consolidation, because it's obviously the top - and from what Sprint and T Mobile has said, we could see an announcement as early as next week. Can you talk about how you think a Sprint, T Mobile merger will change the competitive landscape and would you argue to the SEC and [indiscernible] in favor of approving a transaction like that?\\n\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes Craig, look I would tell you, there is a lot of various rumors and so on around the industry overtime around various M&A activity and I’m not going to comment on other people’s businesses. I would tell you, we have the right set of assets to compete irrespective of the industry structure and that’s what we are focused on and I’m very confident in our ability to be successful however things play out with other people?\\nCraig Moffett\\nThanks. Could I ask, since there’s not much to say on that topic, one separate question then? Could you update us on the 5G fixed wireless broadband trials, what you are seeing and how that informs your expectations for what you are going to do in 2018?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nAbsolutely. So we will have more specifics on that later in the quarter and we will get the right folks talking about that. But I can say the trials are going very well and we are getting a lot of good experience using the millimeter wave spectrum and some other things we are seeing whether it’s a fact that we can deliver service without needing line of sight, whether it’s think about MDUs and the number of floors we can deliver service to being more than we expected.\\nWe have experienced delivering service in MDUs above 20 floors, which is more than we thought it would be going into the trial. So a number of good things coming out of the trials, we will get back to all of you later in the quarter with more specific details on the results of the trials and what that means for 2018, but nothing has change about our intent to launch the fixed wireless broadband offering during the course of 2018.\\nCraig Moffett\\nOkay, bye guys.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nThank you. Next question please Eunice?\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\\nMichael McCormack\\nHey guys thanks. Matt, in the prepared remarks, you talked about over-the-top and some of the video pressure that we have all been hearing about a lot more recently. How do you guys look at that? When you look at the customers leaving you, is it leaving just the video piece of it and maintaining the broadband connection or are you just seeing a shift to different providers generally?\\nAnd then secondly, the spread between those making device payments in wireless versus those that are on unsubsidized plans, how many of those in your best estimate are people that actually were making a payment plan to you guys, pay off the phone and are opting into sort of a lower price point instead of upgrading the phone?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, thanks Mike. So look on your first question. There is really nothing new here to us in terms of the trends we have been seeing over the past few years around whether it’s cord-cutting or [cord-nevers] (Ph) or whatever else. In fact, we have spoken in the past two or three years ago, we really started to speaking about this and the fact we said the traditional linear TV bundle is not long-term sustainable and you saw our reaction to that when we launched some of the different plans that we launched at that point in time.\\nBut so, we are not surprised by what we are seeing around the TV, but I would tell you what is important, when you move to over-the-top for your video entertainment, the quality of that broadband connection becomes more important than ever and if you want a quality broadband connection Fios and fiber to the home connection is the best option out there. And we continue to see strong numbers on the broadband side of the business as a result of that and we are very confident that the Fios Internet offering will continue to be very strong in the marketplace.\\nAs I think about the spread between the unsubsidized and the subsidized payments. Look, what you have here is you do have customers who were on subsidized pricing, get to the end of two-year contract and they then move to unsubsidized pricing and not necessarily getting there through upgrading to a new device and do a net on device payment plan.\\n\\nBut that migration as we say is largely completely now have 78% of the base which meets virtually all of the consumer bases now on unsubsidized pricing. So as we go forward here the gap between the this year and the last year number will get narrower and narrower. And that's what is going to help drive the service revenue trajectory improvement as we go forward here.\\nMichael McCormack\\nAnd Matt I'm sorry just quickly on the hurricane issue, you guys called out the one penny impact. But anything with respect to volumes in wireless that may have been even better as the hurricanes might have?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nCertainly we had in both Huston and Florida, we have period of times when our stores were closed and certainly that’s an impact. But we also saw good volumes as soon as those stores reopened, customer realizing in times like that you want to be on the best network and so we saw an uptick as soon as those stores reopened.\\nAnd I have to get credit to our teams, whether it be on the network side and all the things they did and also our teams in the distribution side of the business, getting those stores open incredibly quickly after those storms, they did a fantastic job.\\nMichael McCormack\\nGreat. and congratulations Mike and Brady.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nThank you Mike. Eunice Next question please?\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\\nJennifer Fritzsch\\nGreat, thank you for taking the question. Matt if I may, I just wanted to ask on fiber we have all been brought up to be believe fiber is really expensive to deploy. And yet we see you coming into the lower end of your CapEx range. I'm not asking you for guidance on 2018, but are you seeing some savings with these XO properties. Are you deploying those laterals yet, or is that going to be more kind of a 2018 event?\\nAnd then if I also just could ask on the other element of 5G spectrum. I think [indiscernible] you feel comfortable with spectrum might that not even sit in the spectrum auction. Can you talk a little bit of how you as you look at your inventory are you feeling comfortable still with what you have? thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, so I'll answer the spectrum question first. We believe that we have a great portfolio of spectrum. As you look at the 4G network only approximately 50% just over 50% of our spectrum portfolio server in that network today. We have got additional spectrum assets that will serve that network in 2018 whether that the [Refarm] (Ph) and 850 and PCS or whether it would be put in the AWS-3 to work.\\nAnd additionally as you move into the 5G world, we look forward to closing the straight path transactions and the XO spectrum transaction as head into 2018. So we are comfortable with our spectrum positions. As we think about future auctions we will wait to see what is in there or make assessments at that time. but very comfortable with the portfolio we have today.\\nAnd as obviously as we think about added capacity to the network we have more than spectrum as the tools available to us as we go forward, and we have talked about the different technology and architecture tools with LTE Advance and all the different pieces in there. We continue to be able to add capacity as we move to more software defined networking and those type of tools and in obviously densification.\\nAnd that densification based of having more fiber available in the network. So to get to your first question, we continue to deploy fiber and we will continue to do that as we head into 2018 as you say I'm not going to talk to 2018 CapEx at this time, but you should expect to see us continue to be deploying fiber around the country as we go forward to service both wireless but also customers across the rest of our businesses and getting into IoT applications as well.\\n\\nMichael Stefanski\\nJennifer thank you and Eunice next question please?\\nOperator\\nThank you. Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nThanks very much. I was wondering if I could build upon the prior questions around your spending trajectory. If we think about this lower-end CapEx target for the year, how should we consider the outlook against that backdrop of investment? Clearly, focusing on network quality is a clear focus for you folks. I’m just trying to unpack the commentary a touch, whether it’s a shift in some of the spending priorities that’s taking place that’s enabling you to get to the lower end? Are we seeing inflection with the benefits from software-defined networks flowing through the business at this point? Or anything to that effect, Matt?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, good question, thank you Amir. So as I think about the CapEx for the year and where it’s coming in towards the lower end of the range. That’s still going to be around 17 billion of spend, so certainly not in significant number. Some of this is just a timing of the activity with the network teams between 2017 and 2018l. But look, I would tell you that the key thing here and you talk about has there been any shift in priorities and I would say absolutely not.\\nThe priority to continue to invest in the network whether that’s adding capacity for the networks today or pre-positioning the network and being at the leading edge of building the future network technologies, that priority is unchanged and as we had into 2018, you will see that we will continue to spend to continue to do exactly those things. So no major change there, as we head into 2018, more spending on fiber as we pre-position for 5G and continue to make sure we have the leading network.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nThanks a lot, and one follow-up, if I may. In touching upon that 5G commentary, in recent weeks, we have seen some notable developments around the broader ecosystem, in particular the announcement with Qualcomm to accelerate the global 5G standard in millimeter wave spectrum. It seems like mobile 5G, in terms of its availability, is now being pulled forward. Is that going to affect the type of services that you plan to offer? Could we see mobile 5G a bit earlier than anticipated here? Any color to that effect would be great.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So I think we were very proud to be part of that announcement with Qualcomm earlier this week and really what you are seeing there is as we have talked about now for the past two to three years. We said if we put our shoulder behind 5G development. We think, we can accelerate versus some of the timing of safety place. And in fact, there were some people who were saying they didn’t even think 5G was going to be real and if you be able to use millimeter wave spectrum.\\nSo we have demonstrated that by our effort so far, we have brought the ecosystem together, we have push forward the timing of standards coming forward and not surprised by any of that at all. It’s exact as we expected. In terms of the timing of mobile 5G, it’s certainly not a 2018 activity.\\nBut you talk about does it change our view on the types of services we will be able to offer, absolutely not. We have seen a wide range of services that we will be able to offer on 5G has - why we have been so excited about it, quite frankly and while we put our shoulder behind get in the ecosystem to move faster on this than they otherwise would have been and we look forward to being in position to offer those services in the years ahead.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nThanks very much for the input.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nThank you and Eunice we have time for one last question.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\\n\\nTimothy Horan\\nThanks guys. And just upon the CapEx again. Matt are you seeing any benefits from kind of the [SDN] (Ph) in terms of pricing of equipment. And can you just talk about as you move to 5G. should we think about CapEx stepping up a couple of billion dollars a year? there is a lot of articles in the press over the last couple years that it might talk close to $20 billion $50 billion to build out a nationwide 5G network. Any color around that would be great.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes so thanks Tim. So in terms of benefits from SDN and so on, let me show as you not just SDN but also network function, virtualization it does allow the value of some of the hardware you put in the network to change overtime, and how you operate network moves more to the underlying software there. So I think we will see those trends as we continue to expand the network.\\nIn terms of deployment of 5G, I think some of the people who are estimating those numbers are getting ahead of themselves and it’s just too early to tell. So as we have more visibility into the timing of spend around 5G we will share that with you, but it's way too early at this point and I'm not going to comment on those estimates.\\nTimothy Horan\\nAnd then just lastly on the $10 billion of expense reduction. How much of that do you think you'll reinvest and maybe growth in the business. I guess how should we would be think about the longer term margin trend over the three to five year period?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes, so as you think about the money, really wants to be generate those savings it becomes part of the overall pull. But I'm excited about the opportunities that the teams are developing to grow the business going forward and it's important that we make sure that we have the resources in the business to invest in those things. and we can't be investing in those things if we have inefficiencies in the core business to that point in time. So we just think it's a responsible thing to do to make sure that we constantly look at the efficiency of the business and look forward to generating those savings and discussing that more with you in the future.\\nMichael Stefanski\\nTim, thank you and before we end the call I would like turn it back to Matt for a few closing comments.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks Mike. I would like to close the call with the few key points. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our high quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We are well positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry into the next generation of technology with our strong network of assets. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and to generate long-term shareholder value.\\nFinally before I close the call today, I want to personally thank Mike for this commitment and the support he has given to me and many others throughout his career of Verizon. And we wish him all the best in the future. We will also like to welcome Brady Connor to the IR team. I have known Brady for several years and he will be a great successor to Mike in addition to the IR team.\\nThank you for your time today.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference call for today.

Lowell, it's great to have you back here. \\nLowell McAdam\\nThanks, Brett. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being up so early. Before we start into the Q&A, I want to do a shout out to our employees in Houston and in Florida. As you see in the newspaper, incredible devastation down there but the network planning that we did has been just outstanding and supporting the people that are going through all this and the first responders. And Texas is an example, we had less than 2% of our sites off the air; and then Florida, even with the widespread damage across the entire state and with the massive power outages that you all see, we've had less than 10% of our sites out.\\nWe had one story yesterday around our business where one of the community towers that we were on collapsed and our network was still carrying calls even though it was on the ground instead of 100 feet up in the air. So the folks have really done a super job in arranging fuel and hardening the sites and those sorts of things and we're proud as a business that also the telephone that you saw the other night, the hand-in-hand telephone; we had 4,000 volunteers from our call centers going and take those calls. So that along with our $10 million donation for the hurricane recovery; we're very proud of the organization and this is the case where reality meets advertising and reality wins out every time and so we're proud of the network and just wanted to brag for a second, thank our team for all their hard work.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nQ - Brett Feldman\\nIt's good to hear. I'm going to check with my tech team in the back, I just want to confirm the webcast is running because I know this that the clock wasn't started. So, I'll let you guys work on that.\\nLet's talk a little bit about the company overall; if we think about the last three to four years, you've taken a lot of steps to reposition the business. You brought in the minority stake in Verizon, wireless, you sold a variety of non-core assets and you reinvested all others proceeds in digital media, IoT, telemetry, spectrum and fiber. I was hoping you could walk us through the primary growth opportunities that you're positioning the company for and also expand a little bit of whether you feel like you have the asset you need to go after these opportunities?\\nLowell McAdam\\nLook, I'm excited about the industry and if you look at the various companies, you see different strategies and whether you look at the internet companies or you look at the equipment suppliers or you look at the carriers, people are putting a ton of capital into this industry. We've gone through a process of centralizing our assets as Brett has said, we sold out some wireline properties, we sold out some data centers. But we're also now out buying spectrum, buying fiber companies, we just announced WideOpenWest a few weeks ago doing deals with Corning, the Straight Path and the XO acquisition I think set us up very well for the 5G environment. So we're investing and making the very strong network that I talked about in the very beginning, even stronger and the platform for even greater innovation as we move forward.\\n\\nWe're adding capabilities like AOL and Yahoo!, what we call our Oath properties. Over the last year as well, that is positioning us to expand our addressable market from the millions to the billions. And we think there is a great opportunity to provide the mobile services. I don't think there is any debate any more that more and more things are going mobile and less and less things are going fixed line. And so we're positioning the company to what I call skate where the pluck [ph] is going, to be that digital media company that provides mobility services and high bandwidth speeds to customers, no matter where they are.\\nSo your question Brett of do we have the assets? I think any Fortune 50 company that you ask that question to would probably answer it, no matter how good you think you are today you need to be open to look at your new options and buying new things and that's why things like WideOpenWest, when they come to expand our fiber footprint we'll do it. But we stay on strategy, we stay disciplined, if we see something in the M&A area that makes sense to buy versus build, we'll do it but we've also got a very healthy dose of building when you're buying 12.5 million miles of fiber every year for the next three years. So we like our position at this point.\\nBrett Feldman\\nI want to spend a little more time talking about network. Network leadership has always been central to your strategy but your competitors are out there saying that they've closed the gap. We've heard you talk about fiber playing a key role in maintaining that leadership; so I was hoping you can maybe just expand on that and help us understand what does the network or the future for Verizon look like and how is that going to allow you to differentiate it from your competitors who also claim to making fiber investments?\\nLowell McAdam\\nLook, it's easy to run advertising. As I said, we had less than 2% of our sales sites down. One of our competitors said publicly 75% of their network was down. So if they've closed the gap, I would just suggest they have a little bit more gap to deal with. So our view on the network of the future is what we call an intelligent edge network. We are redesigning and 5G is the best example of that Brett. We're redesigning the network to be from the cloud through high speed fiber infrastructure to edge computing to 5G. We think we'll still have 4G but 5G will be the technology that delivers the highest speed and the greatest capability to the customer over the last mile.\\nThat allows us to open up a platform for incredible innovation and maybe now is that we're not trying to make everybody an engineer in the room here. Anyone that thinks about 5G is being the next generation of 4G, a consumer product is really missing what this network is all about. 5G will have five times faster response time in the network. So the network will respond faster than you can blink your eye, less than one millisecond will be the response time. It will have 10 times longer battery life than you have today, will have 100 times the throughput of the network and a 100 times more divisive that can be connected to the network and the overall capacity per spectrum will be about 1000 times more capacity.\\nSo the beauty of a 5G intelligent edge network is you can design a network to meet whatever your specific application needs. Today if you want data service, you get data service and you get everything the same person next to you gets. And the world with the future view on 10 times more battery life you can get that. If you want to do virtual reality and you need millisecond response time or automated or autonomous cars, and you get millisecond response time; you can slice the network to deliver that. It's much more of an industrial focused network than it is a consumer focused network although consumers will get that 100 times more throughput.\\n\\nSo this as in aside, yesterday we opened the new Cornell Tech Campus over on Roosevelt Island here and it is focused on innovation for the digital age, so healthcare, smart cities, smart transportation systems; those are the sorts of -- this is the platform that I think is going to usher in the fourth industrial revolution in this country and today we have the largest platform in the world for 5G. We literally have hundreds of sale sites that we have up and operating and 8 markets moving to 11 markets. The global standards will be done we believe sometime this year. The chip manufacturers will have chips available in first quarter next year for us to incorporate that are on the global standards. So this platform is not two or three years out the way it was a year ago, it's on our doorstep and I think it's going to be huge. So the network of the future is going to be dramatically different than today Brett.\\nBrett Feldman\\nYou're actually running 5G trails right now in 11 cities. I know it's early and you've talked about Verizon update later in the year but I'm curious if there is anything preliminary, you could share about them. And then just as an extension of that, we obviously have to deploy fiber run markets in order to run these and you're doing one fiber up in Boston with a lot of interest in whether we're going to see a lot more Boston's around the country as you prepare for a 5G rollout nationwide?\\nLowell McAdam\\nSo a lot in that question, so let's take that a bite at a time. So we were pretty clear when we went into do the 5G trails that we needed to test things like as line of sight critical because -- I mean, you've even heard some chief technical officers of our competitors say millimeter wave really isn't going to work for this, it won't work for mobility, it has to line of sight, it's more microwave oriented. We knew we had to test that, we had to test distance from the sales side to the consumer. We wanted to see what sort of penetration we could get, the old -- there is a pine needle deflect the signal and is that a problem or not. I would say it right now but every assumption that we went into test has come back better than we had thought.\\nI'll give you a personal example; I was in Soul [ph] a few months ago and we were testing the throughput from a transmitter just under 2,000 feet from our location and we were delivering 1.8 gigabits over service over a millimeter wave. And we said just for the fun of it drive that 2,000 feet the opposite direction, get behind the building, so we had absolutely no line of sight and the throughput dropped to 1.4 gigabits.\\nSo we have seen that the foliage doesn't impacted as much as we thought, we can penetrate more building structures than we thought, we can go higher in buildings than we thought we assume six floors, we're seeing over 20 floors of elevation in the signal. So we're encouraged by it. And we -- I think the other thing that we've been surprised Brett is that the computing tower and the antennas are very different than anything we've seen before. It literally -- you think about the antennas that we have on the towers today, they are about two or three feet high. You have 32 antennas on the end of your thumb, it's the way this works today and the processing power that the computers and the antennas can deliver has helped the signal conditioning dramatically.\\nSo we're partnering with companies like Ericsson, and Intel, and Samsung, and Qualcomm has been a great partner through all of this and we're very encouraged. And I'd also say we've tested millimeter wave in a mobility environment and it's going to work just fine with hand-offs and all that which no one do, it was an unknown. So that's why these field tests are so important.\\n\\nSo now, on your question about fiber placement; in order to get gigabit delivered to your handset or delivered to your home over wireless, you've got to have some pretty big pipe. So we're building as Brad said in Boston, we've announced Sacramento, we've got a bunch of cities around the country that the cities are embracing us to come in and provide this sort of broadband service for the citizens. You've all seen the trends, more and more people are moving into the cities and they need to have smart city application; so smart lighting, smart parking, transportation, information services.\\nSo they are embracing us coming in. Boston led the way, [indiscernible] has been a great partner there with permitting an access to conduits and those sorts of things and we're seeing that grow. So that's why we went out and did the deal we did with Corning for 12.5 million miles of fiber a year for the next three years which Wendell Weeks as their CEO likes to say, that's enough fiber to string to Mars. So that's what we're putting in the ground and we think there is an awful lot of potential there.\\nBrett Feldman\\nAnd it really seems like you are viewing this as a nation-wide option. There is no market you won't go to with this fiber.\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, there is no market that isn't on the table, let's put it that way. And we've had a couple of cities that kind of went their way, they tried to go in the past to stay well in order to come in you're going to have to pay this, this, this and this and we've said, no, next. And there is the other cities that are seeing that this is a tremendous value, this infrastructure can provide to them. So we have plenty of work lined up and we're going to push this out as far as it makes sense for our shareholders.\\nBrett Feldman\\nFiber sounds capital intensive; do you believe you can meet your fiber goals within your current $17 billion CapEx run rate?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, we think we can for now. If you think about it, we've been investing for years in 3G technology and Fios buildout and we're now repurposing those dollars to 5G technology and fiber buildout but it's a different architecture than what we've done before. Everything we've done in the past is sort of purpose built, it was built either to support the sale side or support the enterprise. The new architectures that you see with the software defined networks in the intelligent edge, the fiber doesn't care and so neither do we; what service it goes over and you just -- you put it out there, it's common service, nor the way we used engineering or office fiber services.\\nBrett Feldman\\nGot it. And late last year you made news; you said that there was industrial logic to potentially acquiring a cable company. And it wasn't because you were talking about bundling, you were talking about potentially gaining access to fiber. And so I'm curious, are you still evaluating a potential acquisition to cable assets or have you moved on?\\nLowell McAdam\\nNo, we've moved on. And I think you saw the Corning deal or WideOpenWest deal, the Straight Path deals; we've confirmed that the architecture that we see for the future is what we want to do and when we -- we did I guess about a year ago, go through a process of taking a lot of their cable companies but the fiber infrastructure isn't there. And to -- you certainly get customers that are great companies, no -- not at all trying to be critical, they've got a good financial model but for the future that we see that's going to need that kind of bandwidth for customers, you're going to have to have deep fiber into the network and to pull out a lot of co-action and put in the fiber, I'd rather just put in the fiber. So we've moved on from those discussions.\\nBrett Feldman\\nSo you will be building this yourself where it makes sense if you could find tucking acquisitions where it makes sense, it will be balanced?\\n\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes. I mean look, this is just a classic -- we're engineers at heart, this is one of the facts to show you that the facts shared, you can build it better than you can buy it, then you do it. I think right now a lot of the fiber companies; their values are a little fluffy [ph] compared to what you can build it for yourself and so that's the path that we're on but you do see pockets like WideOpenWest in Chicago that made sense to do and we're going to keep our options open.\\nBrett Feldman\\nAll right. Let's talk a little bit about the wireless market right now. Earlier this year, you launched your first ever unlimited plans for 4G and that was a move I think caused a lot of investors to worry about the health of the wireless sector. So my first question would be what's your view on the health of the wireless industry right now?\\nLowell McAdam\\nLook, if you -- sort of back to our first question, if you look at the amount of capital that's moving into mobile; if you look at how every internet company is trying to get deeper ties to mobile, that is going to be the center going forward. So I don't view this as unhealthy in any means. I think there is great opportunity here for us and we should continue to push it.\\nBrett Feldman\\nCan you talk a little bit more about how your unlimited plans have impacted your business relative to your expectations?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes. So as you look at the history of the industry, we've been able to take cost out either faster or roughly equal to how pricing has come down. And we made no secret from the beginning, we weren't wild about unlimited plans because of the potential impact on the network. But again without going too deep into network technology, we -- the industry has been developing capabilities to put in place to manage capacity, you hear it call prodding or now you see different services that will provide 400 or 700 or 1080p service; so the video will put a different load on the network. So we resisted this for a long time and while we were doing that we've put in place the things that would help us take cost out of the network and provide that service better. So by the time we've got to February of this year, we felt pretty comfortable that the network could handle it.\\nAnd if you look at route metrics and JD Power, we continue to have that by a significant margin, the best network out there. Now one of the consequences of that that's been positive is the cost reduction. It's a much simpler plan for consumers, so we see more buying services online and servicing online, our calling rate has dropped dramatically and our churn is at the lowest point that it's been in my career at Verizon and I've been on the ground since day one. So there has been a significant amount of cost come out of it as well but it has -- we're not saying it didn't had more capacity than the network, it did. But overall, the trade-offs I think from an overall customer satisfaction and our financials have been strong, we feel fine.\\nBrett Feldman\\nThe [indiscernible] move unlimited?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWe're about 60% now I think. Let me just check with Mike. Okay, network managed services at 60%, we have not disclosed our actual numbers on unlimited. Thanks to our IR folks in the front row here, thank you.\\nBrett Feldman\\nOne more question on unlimited units, you tweaked the pricing recently, you originally had a one plan for this and you decided to go effectively alone on hiring plan. And I'm curious how much of that was driven by what you are seeing in the market and to what extent was it related to the network because there is some network management features associated with these?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, it's a little bit of a set up in my view for 5G, Brett. Every customer doesn't need unlimited service at 1080p, most of your handsets really don't have the capability to discern more than 400 or so. So we said when we first came out in February with unlimited that this was a promotional plan and we would adjust as we go forward. I think unlimited has got a lot of legs and we thought of it from a marketing perspective, from our ability to offer different types of plan, we just came out with a new loyalty program called Verizon Up that we can tie to the services that you buy from us.\\n\\nSo I think there were some concern from investors that unlimited was just going to be a race to the bottom and we think you can dimensionalize this in a lot of different ways and differentiate from competition, not only on network quality but some of these services and you're starting to see that. I mean AT&T is bundling DirecTV and T-Mobile is doing Netflix and we're doing more with sports and we'll be integrating with our Oath properties as we go forward. So there is lots of dimensions you can add to an unlimited plan.\\nBrett Feldman\\nYes. I was going to throw to you a follow-up question which is that your brand is always really been about network quality and I'm curious as the industry evolves, do you think that that should continue to be the primary association or do you think you need to attach other identities to the Verizon brand as well?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, the way I just describe this to my team is our persona in the marketplace should be like a diamond and you can turn it around and see different facets of it. The biggest draw is going to continue to be network quality. I've been around the industry a long time Brett, every time you are about to move to the next generation there is a little bit of a stacking up of the network. Back in the analog days, everybody got, so they had similar networks and they want to digital and -- but then when you make the jump like we did from 3G to 4G there was a huge differentiator because certain companies were willing to invest in the network and make 4G matter and others held back.\\nAnd I think we're on the same threshold right now, we're the only one that has the spectrum, we're the only one that has 100 sales sites out there and we're going to push this one hard. So differentiation of the network is going to be the cornerstone for our business for years to come, that doesn't mean we aren't going to add a lot of other capabilities like our own properties.\\nBrett Feldman\\nI'm sure you've debated a lot about the structuring position which you mentioned because we always have just enough information to be dangerous. So we look at the spectrum portfolio, we divide it by your subscriber base and it looks the lowest ratio; you've got the biggest base, you've got always unlimited customers now. How are you comfortable that you have the right spectrum recently?\\nLowell McAdam\\nI think one of the things we have to do a better job at is to educate our investors about how network management has changed. I think our investors are sort of in the 2005 and 2010 architecture and there has been so much change in how you densify your network, how you deploy small cells. The things that you can do in software, you hear a lot of the buzz words of software defined networks, all of those things make managing the network and the amount of spectrum you need go down. We've proved time and again and we had a sales side analyst event, I think in May where we did a deep dive on Chicago and showed by placing these small cells with a much denser fiber network too by the way just to tie that and you manufacture capacity at a much better rate than you could buy spectrum at the AWS auction.\\nSo we've been relaxed about that from the AWS auction, I know there is a lot of angst around there, especially those that want to sell us more spectrum but we love the position we're in and now with 5G, with the XO spectrum and when we close the Straight Path option, we will have a very large chunk of millimeter wave spectrum which you will be able to deliver these very high bandwidth speed. So our network portfolio is great, that doesn't mean we won't dress up in a few places here or there but as far as getting to do massive purchases, we don't really even have to participate the next upcoming auction.\\n\\nBrett Feldman\\nI just talk a little bit about the digital media business; so you closed the acquisition, [indiscernible] operating company earlier this year, buying new AOL and you remained at that post. First, can you just give us an update where are you in terms of the integration, what have you achieved, what's still to come?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes. We like that business. The lower we look at it and I've done a lot of acquisitions over my career and you see the old facets sitting very nicely with the Yahoo! assets. The Yahoo! team has tremendous technical capability, their product development group is really exciting, their data analytics team is extremely strong, they are in places like Israel and around the world they've got just tremendous capability. And the AOL team has great sales capability, great ad-tech capability, and I think they are both really happy to be with each other. They are -- the one advantage of the delay because of the breach within Yahoo! is the teams got to know each other better and we are able to develop a very strong integration plan; and Tim Armstrong and his team under [indiscernible] leadership have moved through that very well, we've taken a lot of the cost synergies, lot of the business and now we're putting together some content deals that we like that will not only play across the old facets but play across mobile and play across files as well. So we're excited about the possibilities. There is a lot of work there, I mean we want to go from $7 billion in revenue today to about $10 billion by 2020. But we think there is a lot of interest and a lot of excitement.\\nBrett Feldman\\nAny timeline of these big content deals?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, I wouldn't be surprised if sometime for the end of September you hear about one of them anyway.\\nBrett Feldman\\nOkay. I want to come back to that financial objective you've said going from $7 billion revenue to at least $10 billion revenue by 2020. What do you need to get right in order to get to that level? That's obviously a meaningful amount of growth.\\nLowell McAdam\\nSo I think the platform piece is the first one. Tim is going through a period of sort of decommissioning and then reinvesting in certain platforms. The teams; I'm going to be out with them next week in Sunnyvale [ph], the teams have got a great product portfolio and moving content between the different applications is going to be important whether it be Yahoo! sports or Yahoo! finance or the news piece. So we have to get those right and then I think one of the keys for me Brett is making that matter on the mobile side and on the file side, and we can see -- we do a lot of work on strategy. We see how the strategies should play across the assets of Verizon but until customers start voting with their wallets, those are theories at this point. So I think that's what we have to get right going forward.\\nBrett Feldman\\nThat's a question that we get a lot which is this, natural synergy, if there is any between the networking business and the digital media business? And you know, when we had Randall Stevenson [ph] up here, the way he essentially articulated it was -- we used to monetize our network as per usage and now you can monetize the intelligence that network provides by doing addressable advertising. When are you going to know whether there is a real synergy there or not and you have to have that synergy for close to fit into the company.\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, I read Randall's comments on that and I think there -- I think our heads are in the same place. The data analytics between the network and Oath for us is something we think has tremendous value and the advertisers that have come and visited with Tim Armstrong and his team, they think there is a lot of value there. It's a very competitive industry, I'm not quite as bullish on the CPM increases as Randall might be, I hope he is right. But I do think that today whether you're on the website or you're on your phone, better targeted ads is going to be better for the advertisers and better for consumers. The thing that I like about our position Brett is, I used to think originally 5 million Fios Video customers was a big number and then I thought, okay, 115 million wireless customers is a big number, we ought to be able to make that matter. Now when you look at 1.3 billion users across the globe, you really change your mindset. And I think if we ought to be the ones that make that work with that sort of addressable market, there aren't many companies that have that.\\n\\nBrett Feldman\\nYou're in a market now that's dominated by Google and Facebook, do you feel comfortable that you have the access and capabilities that you need to go up against them?\\nLowell McAdam\\nLook, I mean we don't need to -- we're not here saying we're going to slay Google, but we have to keep our targets in mind here but that market -- you look at Facebook's numbers, Google's, that market is growing pretty well. We don't need to get very many percentages of that to hit that $10 billion number that we talked about. And Tim knows that his target is closer to 20 and in the time that goes after that and so the advertisers are looking for an alternative and I think our approach to delivering video and having that content available on your mobile device and a lot of that -- a lot of those other content deals will be focused more on Oath and they will be on wireless. So I think there is some real opportunity then.\\nBrett Feldman\\nYour [indiscernible] on video business is just the Fios business, you have 4.7 million Fios Video customers, that base is pretty small company, actually. And I believe you said here this conference at linear video is dead; so how do you think about…\\nLowell McAdam\\nI made a lot of friends after I said that.\\nBrett Feldman\\nSo the question is, what you're doing to reposition your video business for a more training centric world?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, I think that's where 5G and over-the-top come in because even in the markets where we have our files footprint from Washington to Boston, the preferred method, the preferred architecture for us is going to be that last mile being 5G. So whether we offer a linear package or we offer an over-the-top package, look, the numbers all show that over-the-top is gaining ground and the 300 channel bundle is under a solitaire. So I may have been premature when I was up here a couple of years ago saying that but I still see it that way and I think the point for our investors is, we're building the network that doesn't care. If you can get broadband I don't care whether the customer goes over-the-top or buys a linear package, and we'll be able to provide either one to him.\\nBrett Feldman\\nThe numbers also show that over-the-top products don't look like they make money; so what would be the rational for having that type of product?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, I mean if it -- the customer today what we see is they are more sticky if they have video and we get better penetration in those market where we have video as well as broadband. I think that is -- you're seeing more video, slightly more video ads that recorder then broadband, that's flip now. I mean we're two to one, broadband to video. So I think the point is Brett, we want to have the network that people can provide whatever service they want on it, we'll make a lot of those services available through us but the main driver of the financial engine of Verizon is going to be the network.\\nBrett Feldman\\nSo if we think about that strategy to potentially take 5G as a residential broadband service anywhere in the country, you're comfortable taking that as a standalone service and if they want video, you have it but you're not necessarily doing this because of bundling?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, absolutely. Look, I think it's -- the logic for us is in order to -- you know, 4G is going to be around for a long time, think of that as the base where we're putting in fiber and small cells to manufacture capacity for 4G. When you build a 4G small cell, you get the right footprint for a 5G small cell. So then your network can handle pretty much anything, whether it's a smart city application or an autonomous car, gaming, virtual reality, healthcare, whatever it is; you let the customer do whatever it is they want on their network. We'll innovate and we'll provide services, for example, telematics; we've got the platform that rides on that, we've got the application that rides on that, we can take that application anywhere in the world and deploy it profitably, that doesn't mean we have to. And so going into Albuquerque or whatever city we choose to go into with 5G doesn't mean that we're going in providing filed service and doing things the way we've done in the past. Again, this 5G network is going to be very different than what we've done in the past.\\n\\nBrett Feldman\\nAnd if I think about what you just said, the idea that when you build the 4G site, you're essentially creating a 5G site; that implies that the incremental costs to you to deploy 5G is very low, that would imply that you can go to market with a very attractive price versus the incumbent broadband providers. Is that a fair assumption?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes. If you look at the history of the company, whenever we've gone into a market we've gained 35%, 40% market share in a reasonably quick period of time. Frankly, the factor that held us back was the cost of taking the fiber into the home and all the labor associated with the work inside the home. Now we'll mail [indiscernible] and say here is how you turn it on. So it's not -- it's a very different cost structure for us.\\nBrett Feldman\\nIf we take a look at your guidance for this year, this is going to be the second consecutive year where your earnings have essentially been flat. And the biggest headwind to that has been the decline in wireless services revenue which has a variety of factors behind it; there is some pricing adjustments, the EIP math factors into that as well. Do you still feel comfortable that your wireless service revenue will be able to stabilize in a year-over-year basis as we get into the second half of next year?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, so let's talk about the revenue side of that and the cost side of it, Brett. So we shared in the same May sort of timeframe how unlimited and EIP and some of the other pricing plans, changes that we've made have put pressure on revenue and we've seen the dilution and we predicted that would flatten out around the middle of the year and then we begin to see less dilution in the second half of the year and then some accretion in 2018. And we feel we're absolutely on-track for that. So that has gone well and I'm encouraged frankly by the discipline that there prepares to be around promotions for the iPhone, so there is nothing that I think would take us off for that.\\nOn the cost side of the business, though we're very focused there; when Matt Ellis came in as our CFO -- about almost a year ago now, he got very involved in our lean six sigma work that we used to redesign processes and we've done a pretty good job of taking cost out but I'd say also avoiding costs as we've gone through this year but Matt and I have decided that we see a real opportunity to take hard dollar cash out of the business and we've set a target of taking $10 billion of cost hard cash out of the business in the next four years. So '18, '19, '20 and '21 and our goal is we'd be able to fund our dividend through cash savings in 2022. So we're implementing a very rigorous process around zero base budgeting combined with our lean six sigma process and we're confident.\\nNow I know everybody is going to want to update their spreadsheets on Verizon and that's -- we're not here to do too much of that with you, a lot of that -- it will take time to bring out of the business, it will be more backend loaded but $10 billion of cash out of the business between OpEx and CapEx over the next four years is a target we believe we can deliver.\\nBrett Feldman\\nSo if we think about the targets around cost savings, we think about the guidance you've just given, reiterated around stability and wireless services revenue; with type of earnings trajectory should investors we expecting out of Verizon and do you think you could earnings growth as early as 2018?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, I think we'll wait and talk about 2018 when we get to 2018. And we'll talk about capital and earnings and that sort of thing, and then Brett, I'll punch on that one until we get in the January.\\nBrett Feldman\\nI had to try. You currently have almost $120 billion of debt, you've got a dividend, you've got a track record of growing at 2% or 3% annually, you recently increased it. Can you help us think about what the company's allocation prior years are going to be -- yes, you go forward and execute against his plan.\\n\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, it really doesn't change for us. We've been very consistent under IVAN [ph] and during my six years on the job as well. Our view is that you have to keep investment and the network to be relevant as an infrastructure provider in this country, especially where you have all the innovation growing that we have. We know our investors, the majority of them hold our stock because of the dividend and we're out in front of investors all the time and that message gets reinformed and our board was very comfortable. I think it's the 11th consecutive increase that we've had in dividend in the last -- then we announced just last week.\\nAnd then even though there was some movement by the rating agencies and what counts as debt and what doesn't and we decided we're just going to continue to run the business the way we've run it. We're planning on paying down debt just the way we said we were going to. So that maybe evaluated a bit differently because of asset-backed securities and all the other things that they do to figure out your rating but we're still running the business, exactly the same way we still plan on paying down debt, paying dividend and investing in the network.\\nBrett Feldman\\nAnd we have time for one last question and it's a standard one, I've asked you a few years in a row now which is; when we have you back here next year; what successes do you want to be talking about and what do you think would be the key growth opportunities you will be focused on as you look into 2019?\\nLowell McAdam\\nI think the big focus for us is the company is evolving the network and that means making 4G as efficient as we can so that we can continue to offer the services customers want at a profit. There probably will continue to be pricing pressure in the industry and it's a competitive, very competitive industry right now but we're positioned with the network assets and by taking cost out of the business we think we can still deliver substantial financial returns to our customers. The dimensions that I want are Ad, or to make Oath matter as a media business, they've got great assets, they've got a great team.\\nWe see opportunities to make that matter to the rest of our business, and then to push the technology envelope forward through few things like 5G. We've invested more than any other company, we will have more experience than any other company; and when we begin that fourth industrial revolution we think we'll be at the forefront providing those services.\\nBrett Feldman\\nGreat. We're out of time. Well, thanks for being here.\\nLowell McAdam\\nOkay. Thank you, all.\", '/article/4105449-verizons-vz-management-presents-bank-america-merrill-lynch-media-communications-and': 'Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) Bank of America Merrill Lynch Media Communications & Entertainment Conference Transcript September  8, 2017 11:00 AM ET\\nExecutives\\nMatt Ellis - Executive Vice President and CFO\\nAnalysts\\nDavid Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\\nDavid Barden\\nThere you go. Come on. Bring on, bring on. There you go. There you go. Thank you. SD-WAN intended.\\nMatt Ellis\\nIt’s quite in the statement.\\nDavid Barden\\nAll right. Thank you, guys. We’re going to reset here. And I’m very pleased to have with us to kind of kick off day two of the keynote sessions, Matt Ellis, who’s the EVP and Chief Financial Officer of Verizon. Before we get started, I think, Matt has to do a quick Safe Harbor.\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. Good morning, David. Great to be here with everyone. The Safe Harbor statement should be appearing on screen here in a second. Obviously, we’ll be making some forward-looking statements this morning. For those of you listening in, it’s also available on our website. So, great to be here, looking forward.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nQ - David Barden\\nThank you so much. So, one of the -- I’d like to start off by just getting more of a kind of a high level question I asked AT&T this. I asked Sprint this question. It appears to me, I think, others as well, that there’s these two polar philosophical views of what it takes to be a successful distribution company in the U.S.\\nAnd in the case of Verizon, you’ve espoused a very long-term consistent view that distribution delivered well, has its own inherent premium value and it can attract its own customer base. And I think AT&T has kind of adopted a different view which is that eventually that distribution capability becomes commoditized and you need to augment it with a bundle and content.\\nAnd I think, there’s been some conversation about whether T-Mobile, which has been kind of more neutral in this conversation kind of edged towards the AT&T side of the world by launching a new bundle with Netflix, which says to the market, look, I think, T-Mobile, I think, content is going to be an important part of the decision making process for customers and therefore, I want to have some of the best content I can get married to my network, so I’m a little bit more into the AT&T camp.\\nSprint maybe, again, kind of espoused a view that they didn’t agree with that. Where -- could you kind of give me now after all the things the Verizon has gone through for the last six months strategically and kind of thinking about the world, where are you guys standing now?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. So, we believe that the network performance and network leadership is an incredibly important part of our strategy. And when you think about the strategy, there’s really three key things; one is network leadership; second one is how we execute around growth opportunities; and thirdly, we think around the balance sheet and cap allocation and those things.\\nSo I will probably jump in two or three of those. On the network leadership, I think, we’ve demonstrated time and again that it does matter. And you see it matter not just in terms of the results we get on the network but the customer numbers have come along with that. So, it clearly resonates with customers that having the best network matters to a significant number of them and we saw that.\\nThe move to unlimited helped us have a clear incomparable offer in the marketplace. The network has performed incredibly well since we’ve gone to unlimited. We’re continuing to add capacity and we have a number of tools that we use to add capacity, and we will continue to do so.\\nBut we’re not just building the network to add capacity for today. I mean some of the things we’re doing as we densify the wireless network with small sales, as we do things like the One Fiber initiative in Boston that we started last year, building a rich fiber network that will deliver multiple use cases in the future off of that one asset and also prepares us with future technologies like 5G as well.\\n\\nSo we already have some of the network architect in place as we go down that path. So the network is in a great place, performing incredibly well and we think it continues to be a differentiator, and it matters to customers.\\nOn the execution side, I think you’ve seen the numbers. The second quarter shows that we can compete effectively, and we will continue to do so. We’re continuing to drive those opportunities for growth and as we talked about on the second quarter earnings call, you’ve got the -- we saw the second quarter as the turning point for service revenue in wireless and we see those -- that those negative trends getting significantly better in the second half of this year, and as we head into 2018, a clear line of sight to getting back to a year-over-year growth at some point next year.\\nWireline, we see continuation of recent trends. But then excited about the future on some of the newer businesses we have. Obviously, in the last 90 days, we’ve -- we closed on the Yahoo! acquisition, so we’re deep into the integration of that asset with the rest of the Oath platform and excited about what that will produce as we head into the future.\\nAnd then within the IoT space, the -- obviously, a number of things going on there, but primarily in telematics where we’ve taken those -- the core business we had. We added two other businesses late last year, integrating those into a market leadership position and see growth there. But those -- both of those assets are built off of growth, driving more volume across the network and monetizing out the stack as we do that.\\nAnd then, finally, capital allocation is incredibly important, and I think, what we’ve demonstrated again in the first half of the year is that we can fund the continued investment in our networks. We can fund the dividend increase as we did yesterday for the 11th consecutive year, out of the cash we generate from our core businesses.\\nAnd at the same time that we do that we also can have the opportunity to strengthen the balance sheet. So network leadership matters. It gives us the opportunity to drive new revenue streams in a disciplined fashion and produce good returns for our stakeholders.\\nDavid Barden\\nSo, let’s start with the kind of post-unlimited service revenue evolution. I think, at the inauguration of unlimited, it was received badly and it had a pretty negative sequential impact on ARPU of about $1.50, all of which was backend loaded into the first quarter. All things being equal, second quarter ARPU should have declined another $1.50. But it didn’t. It was only down about $0.80 or so. And that meant, to me, that there was some other force at work and my guess is that force at work was people upselling themselves to this unlimited plan from lower. So there’s a positive mix shift.\\nSo as we look in the third quarter, assuming that we’ve got stable subscriber phone growth, which I think you guys would agree with and assuming that you’ve got a relatively stable industry pricing structure for the third quarter, which it appears we have, and that mix shift continues to occur, that ARPU should start to go positive sequentially, if not stable. And so positive phone subscriber growth, stable deposit ARPU growth, even if it’s not year-over-year positive service revenue performance, we should see, I think, sequentially positive service revenue performance, is that fair?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. I think, what you saw in the first quarter is obviously the part of your base that has the opportunity to move to unlimited and also step down in total price, those customers move immediately and we fully expected that when we launched unlimited. We saw that from the customer base, the significant appetite for that new offering and so you got that impact in the first quarter, those customers who are paying for a very large data bucket at high price stepping down.\\n\\nAt the same time, those customers who wanted to get to unlimited, but it was an increase in price, that happen so far at much a steady progress but over a longer time period. And so we saw that -- we saw some of that in the first quarter, but we saw it continue in the second quarter and we’re seeing it continue in the third quarter too. But during that quarter, they’re not offset by the people stepping down as much because those people move very quickly.\\nDavid Barden\\nRight.\\nMatt Ellis\\nSo we do see improvement there. We talked about overage and the impact there. We said in the second quarter overage was down about 34% year-over-year. But in terms of you think about that impact on service revenue as a whole, we’re now down to overage revenue being low-single digits of the total number and not all the base is moving over to unlimited either. So we’ll work through that headwind fairly quickly. So, yeah, I think, you’re -- it’s not unreasonable to expect sequentially to see very similar numbers at the service revenue line, and therefore, up and down the income statement.\\nDavid Barden\\nOh! That’s good. So if one of the effects that’s been helpful to the aftermath of the introduction of unlimited, which is this positive mix shift up the revenue curve, your recent bifurcation of rent, of the price plans, you have now a little bit more expensive plan for the HD and a little bit less expensive…\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\n… plan for the throttle video, is that going to have a positive, negative or neutral effect on the mix shift tailwind, are more people going to choose the cheaper option now…\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\n… rather than the aided, are options means that that tailwind kind of goes away or how does that work?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. So, historically, we’ve liked to give customers options in the product they purchase, they can look at. Not everyone is a high video streamer. And so we have an option for people who may not do a lot of video streaming. But then we also have an option for people that’s important to and we like creating those differentiated offerings.\\nWhen we launched unlimited, we described it as an introductory offer, because we knew we wanted to get back to a place where you had those different offerings, obviously over the past few years, it’s primarily been around the data bucket size. When you move to unlimited that kind of goes away. So the question we worked through is, okay, how do we create the differentiated product in an unlimited world and that’s what you’ve seen us launched.\\nAnd certainly when we talked about our view of service revenue in the second half of the year and into ‘18 on the earnings call in late July, we had a pretty good idea of the specifics of what the new price plans we’d be coming out with. So that view that we gave around service revenue in the second half of the year and into ‘18 was based off of bringing these new plans on and we think we’ll see a good mix of customers and it’s not materially going to overall impact the ARPU numbers.\\nDavid Barden\\nSo looking at then the landscape generally.\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\nIn the quarter, I would argue we had maybe four different kinds of events happen. We had the -- we had Sprint kind of experimenting with the trade-off of phone subsidies and retail distribution in exchange for like a year of free unlimited service. Secondly, you had T-Mobile raise prices for the ONE Plus by about $5.\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\nFrom $5 to $10, at the same time, you had T-Mobile kind of introduce this Netflix plan. You had new guys kind of bifurcate your plan. Is -- a big question that people have been asking over the last couple of days has been it -- where are we on the price deflation curve? Like, are the actions we’re seeing happen representative of stability, incremental deflation, reflation, where do you think we are in that curve?\\n\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. It’s a constant evolution. And what was key for us this year was getting back to having an offer that was comparable and so went unlimited and we did that, because prior to that customers had to make a choice between a good network experience or being on unlimited and not having to worry about data usage. We took that away and I think what you’ve seen from a number of the other folks in the industry since then is they’re trying to find ways to make their offer different against the leadership position we have.\\nI’ll tell you, we continue to focus on protecting our base in a disciplined fashion and so we look at all these different offers that are out there. We believe that our core offering continues to operate very competitively, despite all those moves that you talked about. So, we’ll continue to monitor it. I don’t think you’ll see it. It will change significantly. But we will continue to do what we need to do to protect base in a very disciplined fashion.\\nDavid Barden\\nAnd so, I think, the cornerstone of the value proposition that helps you defend that basis is network.\\nMatt Ellis\\nAbsolutely.\\nDavid Barden\\nAnd I think that maybe one of the most definitive things that I saw Verizon do over the years was when you guys, so many years ago launched pre-standard LTE and you went several years before the competition and you had a national LTE, and that created the whole map game, and you guys were able to take a lot of market share. I think those were the healthy days for Verizon in the market. And you guys have described how there’s an inevitability that you reach a plateau on network deployment. Eventually everybody kind of gets LTE deployed a lot of places. Lesser filled networks are going to have more capacity, be able to market higher speeds.\\nAnd I think that there’s an angst about how Verizon in this next one year, maybe two years, before the 5G evolution creates an opportunity to create distance, how you maintain a measurable amount of distance that can support a 20% price premium in the market within the largest customer base with the highest margins in the U.S. How do you convincingly talk about that? What are your bogeys? What do we expect to see?\\nMatt Ellis\\nI would just look at second quarter. I mean, so we had a price premium that we continue to believe reflects the quality of the network and we had a 0.70 churn number in the second quarter. Now, as we head into the third quarter, seasonally, you typically see a little bit of an uptick around that. But we can -- if that price premium was too high or the product was coming too close together in terms of our to know the peoples, we wouldn’t be able to have that price premium and have the gross add, the net add numbers we saw in the second quarter, the churn number from the base we saw in the second quarter.\\nSo I understand the question. We hear it a lot, but when I look at the performance. But there’s a lot of noise in the marketing about the networks and getting very similar. But I think customers understand there is still a significant difference out there. And I think there is -- there continues to be the opportunity for us to have the price premium and to continue to have the largest and most valuable base of customers in the industry.\\nAnd we continue to push some of the LTE Advanced tool, so we can drive more network efficiency, better network performance and we’ll be on the front end as we move into the next-generation wireless technologies.\\nDavid Barden\\nAnd so within the kind of -- within the network itself, under the hood, what is the secret sauce that’s going on, is it the brute force macro cell site splitting, is it adding spectrum by market, is it the densification initiatives that you’ve been doing in markets like Chicago and New York, is it the mix, is there a one thing or is there a long pole on the tent, what is the driving force?\\n\\nMatt Ellis\\nI mean, we continue to add capacity. You mentioned we have a number of tools that we can use and depending on where we need to add capacity, how we need to add it, we can do it through additional spectrum.\\nRemember, we only have a little over 50% of our current spectrum holdings deployed in the LTE network today. So we still got AWS-3 spectrum to be deployed as handsets come out with that band in them, and then, as we move more customers off of the 3G network, we refund that spectrum. So, spectrum is one of the things we can deploy. Certainly, densification is something we’ve been doing for a few years now and believe it is very effective.\\nAnd then, the additional tools in LTE advanced and some of the other technologies out there also provide tremendous opportunities not just to add capacity but to improve the efficiency of the network too. And so we’ve been doing this for a lot of years and we will continue to do it, and I think, we’ve demonstrated that we know how to add the capacity, and stay ahead of the demand from the customer base, and produce a good product that the consumers are willing to pay a premium price for.\\nDavid Barden\\nSo just a related topic, obviously, AT&T won the FirstNet program and I’m going to ask two questions about this, one on network. So, as a part of that, AT&T is going to deploy not just the first responder 700 megahertz, which they’ll have access to in ordinary days. But at the same time they’ll be deploying the -- all the reserve capacity. They’re going to put up all the AWS-3. They are going to put all their WCS. They are going to put all their fellow AWS-1.\\nSo in another 24 months to 36 months, AT&T, we have every conceivable unit of capacity plus more available to it to kind of create the network experience that I think every operator would love to have, if you’re using half of your spectrum today and you really haven’t deployed a lot of AWS-3 you’re kind of waiting, is there a risk that AT&T gets to jump on Verizon. What are you doing to play offense with respect to this massive amount of capacity that AT&T is going to put up the next two years?\\nMatt Ellis\\nWell, capacity doesn’t necessarily mean a better product to the consumers. How you use it? I think that’s what we’ve demonstrated over the years. We do a very good job of deploying the spectrum we have. How we deploy it? And I think the results speak for themselves there. So we continue to monitor what our customers are doing. And we’ll do what we need to in response, but very confident that our network performance will continue to be very, very strong.\\nYou mentioned FirstNet. Look we have a significant amount of low band spectrum. And it just wasn’t as important for us to get -- to bid on that as it was for others. But let me be very clear, we view the relationships we have with the public safety community incredibly important. They are great customers and we work very closely with them.\\nThe reason they’re great customers is we have great coverage, we have great reliability and obviously, the people that work in that field coverage and reliability is very important. And so, they have been longstanding relationships with us and we look forward to continuing to have relationships with that community. It’s -- the work they do is credibly important and we’re proud to serve them.\\nDavid Barden\\nObviously, you’ve expressed that view that you have a large incumbent position in the public safety market. Can you size it in terms of opportunity or threat for Verizon?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. We haven’t quantified that on…\\nDavid Barden\\nI wouldn’t ask it if you already quantified it then. So that’s a no? Okay. So, I guess, then, I wanted to then talk a little bit more about, again, it relates to both the network and the strategic side. Could you talk us through this WOW! transaction that you announced?\\n\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\nIt feels to me, at least my story arc was that, Verizon was early to the 5G story, saw that wireline was going to be a big part of it. There was a -- maybe a moment in time where maybe a cable company would have and a wireless company getting together might have made sense. But there was a limit in terms of the cost, benefit trade-off and that kind of went away.\\nAnd now Verizon’s kind of trying to fulfill this idea of becoming the best next-generation network, but it kind of has to do it in a more brute force organic way and this WOW! transaction kind of came out of the field and I’m wondering how it did and what incremental opportunities could be out there to kind of keep doing that sort of thing.\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. I think if you think about that transaction, it fits in with what we’ve been talking about for the last six months, nine months now around the -- our view of how the networks will evolve. And as you kind of mentioned, this integration, as you go forward, the wireline networks and the wireless networks, as you get deep fiber and you need deep fiber for densification in 4G, and certainly, as you think about getting into 5G, that fiber asset is important. And what we’ve looked at and said is, well, if you’re going to have that fiber there, how do you make sure you do it as an asset that can serve multiple uses and not just single-use cases, whether that be wireless backhaul or whether it will be a consumer offering or whatever.\\nAnd so it’s really an extension of what we started in Boston last year, we said we’re going to go in and you’re going to build a fiber network that serves multiple needs, whether that’s consumer needs, whether that’s enterprise buildings, whether it’s small business, whether it’s wireless backhauls, smart city applications whatever.\\nAnd so as we look at the future, we believe there is a need for fiber -- significant fiber build. And this -- you can look out there and say, well, there’s a good amount of fiber out there today, but when you talk about the managing the network, the way I describe for multiple use cases, you need significant amounts of strands of fiber in that network.\\nAnd a lot of the existing networks didn’t have that, so we said, okay, you have there’s different ways you can go about getting from where you are today to ultimately where you’re going to want to be at some point in the future. And so we’ve taken a look at different options. WOW! was a good asset that actually has a lot of the type of fiber that we’re looking for, so…\\nDavid Barden\\nWhat kind of strand density is the minimum, which is -- what is ideal?\\nMatt Ellis\\nWell, in terms of the core and you can get some more detail with the engineers. But in terms of the core part of that network in the city, you’re not talking about four to six strands. You’re talking about something much more significant and we’ve talked about obviously building 1,700-strand fiber cables with Corning, for example. So you’re talking about very significant amounts of strand in some of those -- some parts of those networks.\\nDavid Barden\\nSo are you -- so again, this WOW! deal, are you on the hunt for these deals and if so, have you been in the mix, on say, the deals like Wilcon in LA or the Light Tower deal that Comcast got involved in? Are you in the hunt on these deals and should we be trying to find companies that might fit this mix and see where there might be a fit?\\nMatt Ellis\\nNo. I think, if you look at it, we take a close look at what’s already out there. I think we’ve very familiar with all of the different options that are out there and most of them don’t necessarily come -- we look at it and say, they don’t necessarily bring the asset mix that you would like. You’d have to go do significant more items on it. Now there’s trade-offs. It may still make sense to do that and then you go upscale what’s there or you might look at it and say, I’m actually better off not doing that and go in doing some different path.\\n\\nSo, look, as we add fiber, and I think, we’re being pretty consistent in this, we can buy existing fiber, we can build fiber, or we can lease existing fiber. I think it’s going to be geography by geography will determine what the best, most cost effective approach will be to add the capacity that we can then generate revenue and returns off of.\\nDavid Barden\\nSo kind of building off of that plan to have these fiber deployments, the beginning of the year, you guys are talking about the 11 fixed wireless broadband trials that you’re going to have…\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\n… deployed and you were talking about maybe talking in the second half about kind of results, metrics, expectations, timetables. I think the plan was to have a commercial launch available in 2018. Now that we’ve officially ticked into the second half, I have to ask, how did it go?\\nMatt Ellis\\nWell, the trials are still ongoing. So we’re up and running at eight of those 11 markets. We got customers on those trials experiencing that product and that technology, and we’re getting the results in from that. We picked those 11 markets to have different topographies, density -- population densities and different factors, because if we’re using the millimeter wave spectrum, it’s a very different spectrum than what we’ve worked with previously.\\nAnd the results we’re seeing so far I think are very interesting to us. We’re still working through some things on those trials, so we’ll have more to share later in the quarter or later in the year, sorry, but we do still expect to have a commercial scale launch during the course of 2018.\\nDavid Barden\\nCan you share anything about the trials in general, like the chief challenges, for instance, is it propagation, is it building type in terms of brick or wood or…\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\n… is it those types of things you’re kind of ironing out?\\nMatt Ellis\\nThat’s exactly and that’s why you’re trialing in different locations and so on. It actually is propagation. It’s line of sight versus not line of sight, different materials. As you think about being in the cities, what the MTU opportunity is and so we’re getting the results from those things and we will -- as we said, we’ll have more to share later in the year.\\nDavid Barden\\nSo, just kind of wrapping upon that topic, so as you kind of, I think, have articulated a view that from a content perspective, you’ve kind of got that as a separate business and from a wireless perspective, you don’t really need it. So if we rule that out, and if we kind of say, we’re moving along this path of more of an organic, more brute force kind of fiber deployment in pursuit of a 5G kind of architectures and goals, it feels like in a world where people are expecting the mega deal, Verizon might be more now on the side lines. As you kind of see the strategic landscape unfolding other deals that you root for or are there deals that you are concerned about, are there deals that could happen that could draw you in and maybe kind of pull you off the side lines to get involved?\\nMatt Ellis\\nNo. Look, I would say, if other people are going to do the things, we observe. But we’re very confident in the strategy we have and the way we go forward, and I don’t think any of the things that have occurred so far in terms of different deals over the past two years, three years have shaken our view in the -- that our strategy is the right thing to do.\\nAnd Lowell and I have been fairly consistent that these different things that we get invited to look at. But if it doesn’t allow us to execute our strategy in a way to produces a return, then we don’t go do them. So we’re very confident executing the core strategy and we watch with as much interest as you do at all the different things that may go on, but we’ll play our own game.\\n\\nDavid Barden\\nSo let me ask -- I’ll just ask you can just lighting ground. What’s better, Sprint/T-Mobile separate, Sprint/T-Mobile together?\\nMatt Ellis\\nThere’s a lot of speculation on that. I feel very confident that we’ll be very confident however that turns out.\\nDavid Barden\\nWhat’s better, Sprint T-Mobile together or Sprint cable company together?\\nMatt Ellis\\nI think my last answer applies there as well.\\nDavid Barden\\nOkay. I tried guys. I really did. All right. So maybe shifting gears a little bit to the wireline side. So, Comcast made some news yesterday kind of suggesting that third quarter video subscribers we’re probably going to be a little weaker not dramatically, but just weaker than I think people expected. And I think -- and they attributed that I think to a fairly aggressive promotion that AT&T has been running, although, I hadn’t heard of that promotion. But the -- at the same time, AT&T I think articulated a view that irrespective of whatever was going on the market, they felt like they were going to perform in line with the market and it’s always really hard in the moment to know whether what you’re feeling is a competitive force or a secular force. But then when you look in the rearview mirror, you add it all up and then you can tell what the answer was.\\nMatt Ellis\\nRight.\\nDavid Barden\\nAnd for the last two quarters, what’s been happening is that the secular forces in the linear video business have been getting harder and we’re wondering if that’s accelerating in the third quarter. And so, if AT&T is doing no better than it’s been doing and cables -- Comcast is doing a little worse, how is Verizon doing in the video businesses? Is it -- seasonally, it should be a little better than it would have been, I think, in the second quarter, but I don’t know. Can you kind of comment on whether it’s -- what’s going on in the secular versus competitive market for video?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. Yeah. Look, obviously, there is this trend going on and you’ve seen it in our numbers. Now the people’s numbers over the past few quarters that the trends on the broadband offering and the trends on the TV offering have started to diverge some, and we certainly believe those trends will continue. Look, I would say that, we would see our -- that where we are right now in third quarter, we’d say sequentially we’ll be in a similar type of ballpark as we were in the second quarter. So, it’s a competitive market and but we think our offer competes very well.\\nThe other thing that’s important, as people choose to get more of their content over the top rather than as a linear TV bundle, the quality of that broadband connection becomes more important. And the -- obviously the Fiber-to-the-Home that we have with Fios therefore becomes a -- we think a point of competitive advantage against other options people have in the footprint where we have Fios. So, that continues to be.\\nThe other thing that’s interesting with this pay TV piece, while there’s certainly been pressure on the linear TV numbers, the total amount of content that consumers are watching isn’t declining. So, you’re in this shift of how they consume that content. And so there is some disruption in our pay TV bundle. But we’ve not seen a change in the general trajectory of that trend in the last 90 days or so.\\nDavid Barden\\nHas -- is there any part of Verizon that wants to try to add to the monetization stack of content, as you say, you’re getting the broadband piece for what people are consuming, guys like AT&T you’re trying to and even other companies like CenturyLink are trying to get in the OTT game and try to participate in another part of the consumer content consumption game?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\nIs there any part of Verizon either both or the wireless business or the wireline business that’s looking at other ways to monetize consumption?\\n\\nMatt Ellis\\nWell, we still got significant integration going on. I think you’ve seen us say we do think those businesses are valuable. It allows us to monetize above just the network layer, some of the usage that’s taking place on the network. So that’s why we’ve done some of the things we’ve done over the past couple of years, those couple of acquisitions in telematics last year and some other things we’ve done more broadly in the IoT space.\\nAnd then certainly adding Yahoo! to the Oath platform as well, means that we absolutely see opportunities to monetize and so those teams are heavily in the integration activity right now to make sure we execute on those plans.\\nDavid Barden\\nSo, I think, you’ve relatively -- you’ve gone relatively louder with the gigabit speed tier on Fios and you’re saying, though, that you’re seeing kind of the similar trends in the broadband as we saw last quarters. Why is that gigabit product not causing improvement?\\nMatt Ellis\\nWell, I think, as we think about the way we grow our base, we’re going to do it in a disciplined fashion. And so we’re happy with the trends that we’re seeing and there certainly continues to be strong demand for that broadband product. But we’re going to go after growth in a disciplined fashion at the same time.\\nDavid Barden\\nOkay. And then shifting maybe to enterprise, obviously, the focus of my little talk there earlier, but the enterprise business, I think, for a long time was this GDP growth business and kind of subsequent to the financial crash, it seems like it went from a place of investment and optimism about the returns on business investment in IT to it’s now just a cost center unless just trying to keep it as cheap as possible and so it’s kind of constantly getting ground down. What is the -- as you sit here, what’s the outlook for enterprise and why?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. I think you’re going to see in the near-term the similar trends that we’ve seen recently. There will continue to be price compression. But as you talked about in your talk, there’s new products coming out there and so we’re at the front-end of that with our customers. I think we’re doing a -- we actually had some good wins with our larger customers and so we think we compete effectively there. But I wouldn’t expect a significant change in the overall revenue trajectory of that business anytime soon.\\nDavid Barden\\nDo you -- based on what I was saying about SD-WAN and kind of it being a topic and having -- taking a lot of actually down the room, but not having a real substantive effect on the business, did we say anything or something that you disagree with in particular about where we stand on that development?\\nMatt Ellis\\nI didn’t catch all of the comments, so I can’t say if there was -- all of them we agreed with or not. But, look, it’s an important evolution of the communication stack that we provide to our enterprise customers. And just like any time there’s an evolution to the technology of the offering, your customer base is understanding how quickly they want to move to it and the benefits it brings, et cetera, et cetera. So our team has done a very nice job of bringing those products to our customer base, and I think, we’ll be -- it will continue to be an important part of the offering going forward.\\nDavid Barden\\nAnd from that -- part of the strategy that is centered on the new businesses. There hasn’t been a lot of breaking out of the revenue and the cost structure and kind of some of the drivers of that business. Could you -- right now with Yahoo! kind of and IoT and all the things, I guess, maybe underneath the Marni umbrella, could you kind of give us a scoping, like what percentage of Verizon’s revenue now is all those businesses today?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. We don’t think we’ve given the exact percentage, but certainly when you bring, Tim has talked about the fact that when you look at the combined revenue of the former AOL business and the Yahoo! assets that we acquired on a pro forma basis, around 7%, he’s talked about the challenge of growing that to 10%-plus in the 2020 timeframe.\\n\\nAnd then we’ve talked about the telematics business being on track to be approximately a $1 billion revenue business on an annual basis here as we go through ‘17 and into ‘18, and then there’s other IoT businesses around there, too. So they certainly are starting to move the needle some and we expect them to contribute in a meaningful fashion as we go forward.\\nDavid Barden\\nAre they, as a group, profitable businesses, as they grow revenue, do they contribute to EBITDA and earnings growth?\\nMatt Ellis\\nIt would certainly be my expectation, David, that they would produce a return.\\nDavid Barden\\nSoon.\\nMatt Ellis\\nIt depends what your timeframe is. No, we -- look, they will have -- we have business cases for each of them as we go into any investments like those we create, we know what the return expectation is. Some of them with different timelines than others and we’ll keep very close track on how they’re doing with those, and obviously, as they get bigger, you should expect to see a little more information around it.\\nDavid Barden\\nAnd so, as kind of we move in to the last part of the conversation, just kind of thinking about free cash flow and the moving parts there. So, round numbers, we were expecting rise and to generate call it $14 billion of free cash flow, I guess, with the new dividend, the dividends running probably $10.5 billion or so. That dividend, as it continues to creep up each year, it’s going to potentially tax the operating and free cash flow number. Presumably the CapEx is not going to go anywhere. So can you talk about some of the targets and goals on free cash flow and the big moving parts to that, because…\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\n… if enterprise trends aren’t going anywhere and consumer trends aren’t going anywhere and wireless…\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah.\\nDavid Barden\\n… is kind of flattish, where is free cash flow going?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYeah. So, I think, your dividend number is slightly higher to $10.5 billion. If we assume we keep increasing it, we’ll get there and look forward to that day. But, look, when you look at the business, you go through the cash flow coming from each segment. You’re right about the kind of the enterprise piece and so on.\\nYou’re not going to see massive growth coming from there. But wireless, you’ve had the service revenue decline as we’ve transitioned the business model from subsidy to device payment and we’re essentially through that, and so as you say, we should get back to service revenue being positive on a year-over-year basis during the course of 2018 that will certainly be significant.\\nAs you think about wireless, the other thing to remember too is, although we do the securitization with the handset receivable, we don’t securitize 100% of that balance and so as you’re moving the base over, there’s been a build-up of that receivable, the non-securitized piece on the balance sheet.\\nWell, by the end of this year, we’re essentially through that transition, so that plateaus. So that working capital headwind that we’ve had over the last two years or three years in the cash flow statement should reach a steady state as we get into ‘18 and beyond. So in addition to the revenue trajectory being better, you also have working capital trajectory improve too.\\nAnd then, the other businesses will grow but -- and become cash flow positive and get there. So, look, our confidence in being able to continue to grow the dividend each year is based off the confidence that we will continue to grow cash flow from the business each year, so that we can continue to invest in the networks.\\nOne of the things we’ve done is, we consistently do that and you see the result, it’s not the short type program. It’s a much more predictable and you see the results there. We continue to do that. We understand the dividend is important to shareholders. We continue to fund that and we continue to strengthen the balance sheet and there’s nothing, as I look into the future that makes me think that that’s not going to continue to be something that we deliver on.\\n\\nDavid Barden\\nSounds like we’ve reached the end. Thank you so much, Matt. Appreciate it.\\nMatt Ellis\\nThank you.\\nDavid Barden\\nCheers.\\nMatt Ellis\\nThat’s wonderful.', '/article/4096828-verizon-communications-vz-presents-oppenheimer-20th-annual-technology-internet-and': \"Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Oppenheimer 20th Annual Technology, Internet & Communications Conference Call August  9, 2017  8:10 AM ET\\nExecutives\\nErica Moffett - Associate Director Equity Research and Head of Corporate Access Oppenheimer\\nRonan Dunne - EVP & Group President, Verizon Wireless\\nAnalysts\\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer\\nErica Moffett\\nWelcome to the Oppenheimer 20th Annual Technology, Internet & Communications Conference. As many of you know, I am Erica Moffett, the Associate Director of Equity Research and the Head of Corporate Access here at Oppenheimer. So I really appreciate all of you coming here. And on behalf of all of you, Oppenheimer team we want to thank you for your participation at this conference.\\nI hope everybody had a productive day yesterday and we having other very full day wind up for you today. And right now, we are going to kick it off with Tim Horan and with Ronan Dunne from Verizon. So with that I am just going to turn the floor over to them and get starter.\\nTimothy Horan\\nThanks Erica and thanks a lot for coming Ronan. And I think before we get started we have a safer harbor statement. Everyone got it?\\nRonan Dunne\\nWe're already speed reading. We're done.\\nTimothy Horan\\nSo, Ronan, thanks a lot. We have a full wireless warning here this morning. How long you've been at Verizon Wireless now?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo, I joined in September, so coming up three year at this stage.\\nTimothy Horan\\nGood, good, good. And you had a very successful wireless carrier in London before this. Can you talk a little bit about what you did at O2?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, sure. So for those who don't know me; background is I am a finance guy, an accountant by profession, used to work in banking when that was a socially acceptable thing to do. Then I spent 15 years basically in the industry in the UK with a last eight years before I joined Verizon as the CEO of a business called O2 which was part of the Telefonica Group. And it was a business that earned a reputation is being probably the strongest branded carrier within the wireless marketplace in Europe with a very strong orientation towards customer experience, loyalty and differentiation through service experience as well as through network experience.\\nTimothy Horan\\nGreat, I definitely want to hit on that. Can you - you know just because your background, can you talk a little bit your impressions of the U.S. wireless industry versus what you saw in Europe?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, so it's interesting. One of the characteristics that's distinctly different is that most of the European carriers, their wireless is fundamentally a personal consumption. You know I think everybody pretty much recognizes not, but the structure of the marketplace in the U.S. is that a significant proportion of businesses sold in family plans in multiline plans, whereas in Europe, almost exclusively it's single line. So that's an interesting one. So that creates some interesting opportunities around how we do with family groups, how you make sure that within a family plan you can differentiate the offerings between different parts. So that's probably the single biggest difference.\\nI mean back in the day whether it was calling party pays or receiving party pays used to be a big think in a world of a limited voice that not really a factor. And I think the other thing is that a lot of the European markets were established with an incumbent wireline telco who then became the incumbent wireless telco, whereas you know the evaluation of the marketplace has been different in the U.S. and you know businesses like Verizon, the consolidation of regional players into a pure wireless play. So the kind of the background and the structure of the market a little bit different to where we go to today.\\nTimothy Horan\\n\\nAnd how is the competitive intensity of Europe versus the U.S.?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo, that's interesting. One of the things I would characterize and we've seen a little bit of change in that in the U.S. probably in the last three quarters is I would say that certainly in my market in the UK, more proposition differentiation than heavy promotional overlay. So a lot more of the value in the individual propositions and segmentation. And I think what we've seen in the U.S. particularly in the last couple of quarters is a moving that direction probably in truth occasion by the fact that we've returned to be limited marketplace in the first quarter which meant that there was a little more comparability between the core offerings than perhaps it been last year.\\nTimothy Horan\\nSo O2 was able to gain substantial share and you expanded margins, it was a great success store. What have you learned from that experience and what you can do for Verizon? I guess maybe set another way, what sort of strategy for running Verizon Wireless?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, look great question. Look, I am very excited about the industry overall and that's kind of where I would start. You know demand for our product is continues to growth substantial. And you know if you look across the industry sectors an awful a lot of them were looking to try and generate demand. We have a really, really high quality, problem is we have tons of demand, now we just looking at the way to optimize the monetization of that. So that's kind of the first thing I would say.\\nThe second thing I would say is I think there is a real opportunity therefore to enhance the differentiations, so more specific segmentation of proposition; more personalization within base management. And if I take the experience from the UK specifically and Europe generally, as I think Verizon is incredibly well placed with the preeminent network not just in the U.S. but I'll tell you globally, the reference carrier globally in the wireless industry in Verizon, in every marketplace you go. I was talking to the Strategy Chair of the GSMA the other day making that point. So we have an amazing infrastructure to build on and therefore the opportunity to really build out the Bram [ph] residence in a way that allows us to serve more of the segments in B2B and in B2C, I think gives us a really exciting opportunity within a sector which I think has really growth opportunity.\\nTimothy Horan\\nAnd while you mention it all, you know it's interesting always saw Verizon as an engineering organization going way back to Bell Atlantic and they are very much and very proud on their engineering. So - but when you look at the network, what about the network enables them to be the best global?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, look, when I look at the opportunities, you do please understand me, I think right over core having an incredible strength in engineering is an essential ingredient and therefore our proposition and our strategy is undoubtedly build on continuing to deliver a superior connectivity experience. But you know if I look at the consumer sector, people don't really buy technology, they buy the possibilities that technology enables, they buy the experiences, they buy the connectedness that allows them to do the way they live their lives. So what we really wanted to do is use that superior connectivity that reliability you know from an access reliability capacity coverage you know we are preeminent to know in the marketplace. And when you then build experiences on top of that people can rely on it. So the beauty of it is we have the engineering base. Now I think we have the opportunity to build out the experience suite on top of that.\\nAnd a small example the other day was we've relaunched our loyalty program, something that have been very, very successful for me and the UK. So we've done a major relaunch of a royalty program which will give our customers a real value for their loyalty.\\n\\nTimothy Horan\\nCan you describe that loyalty program?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, sure, so we've launched Verizon the beginning of the month and it has a multiple tiers. So just for participating, there is an opportunity to get access to benefits and offers. Then there is as you recruit credits in this game, there is a next layers of value that you can attract. And then as you go up the pyramid, there is the money can't buy opportunities. There is the access to sold-out tickets, there is the experiences at event. And really leveraging a lot of our sponsorship assets whether it be NFL, NBA, music and other things. So real opportunity right across the country on a very segmentive basis to make offers that are value to our customers available to them and really recognize them for their continued loyalty.\\nWhat we are also trying to do is make sure that we personalize those offers. So for example one of the launch offers is three months free HBO for customers who don't have HBO. But we'll actually look in if somebody has an HOB at on their phone, I am not going to offer them up three months free HBO because it's of no value to them. So I'll make sure that the offers carries out for them is to their needs rather than I have that, I have that. So we also have the opportunity to personalize and tailor the proposition overtime to give our customers more choice for the things that they value.\\nSo it's quite an exciting thing because what it really ties up is this idea of essentially a carrier if it does it right is an information company and can be a partner to their customer in a way that adds more value because how we know them and then how we stand that information up for the customer benefit. So they get more than connectivity, they get access, relevant access to offers but also to service this that are important to them. So we're really just scratching the surface.\\nTimothy Horan\\nInteresting and you have to shift Verizon's brand somewhat or you are going come up with flanker brands like, what would you like the main message of the Verizon brand?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, I think if you contrast us to our competitors in the marketplace, it's fair to say by acquisition, all of the other main brands have adopted another brand within the market. And certainly in my experience in Europe both through partnering and the MVNO space, and through introduction of sub-brands, we're able to expand our relevance in the market. We clearly have a very strong reseller business and relationship with TracFone which allows us to address very effectively certain segments of the market. But I think what you'll see is whether it be inside the core brand of out with, what you will see us is broaden that with our offering, create more choice, expand the range of segmented offers that are available. And I would say that as a generic, how we actually execute that in the market, you'll see more of overtime but it won't be, we do in one place, you'll see it more broadly across our portfolio.\\nThis when we launched unlimited, we were very clear and said one single proposition was the start of a conversation, not the end of it. So I think with the network tools we have and the brand attributes we have, we can start to broaden that our proposition quite significantly.\\nTimothy Horan\\nSo you're talking about pretty big sea change and how to think about the company going from a wireless connectivity company to a company where you are improving so much lives and making it simpler and you know basically really surprising them what you do. Can you give some examples on O2 what you did and maybe you know just some other high level thoughts on what you do now and do you have the capabilities I mean are you working on AI to do stuff like I guess?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo I think the first thing to say is this isn't just a B2C proposition actually in many respects B2B is an even more interesting one where allowing our business customers to get closer to their end customers. So in the IoT space and the telematics space, already starting to use both big and small data to give our customers better opportunities to manage their businesses more effectively. Inside our own business, we see machine learning AI, natural language programming as being significant opportunities for us to do a double whammy, one is improve the experience we give to the customer, and at the same time reduce the cost to serve.\\n\\nIn the other area that I know it's one of that you spend a lot of time thinking about is network capabilities these days are sea change different from what they were even five years ago. The ability to segment experiences inside the network, the ability to stand up by private network for an enterprise client, the ability to move the demand cycle in the network. One of the experiences that we've seen since we've launched our unlimited, we're attracting a different mix of customers, and we've seen the profile of usage on the network change significantly. So from a pure yield management point of view, we're selling more of the capacity that we create on the shoulders at off peak than we were previously.\\nSo we put all those pieces together what you will see is there's an opportunity for more segmented value, which is segmentation of the networks capabilities and features, and then segmentation of the go-to-market whether that be the distribution channels or the serve channels, so it might be pure digital only. I have one business in the UK, which had no call centers completely online self-serve, and actually the community of members solve 90% of each other's questions without them ever having to be referenced back to the carrier.\\nTimothy Horan\\nAnd was that another separate brand?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYes it was. So in the UK it was a brand called giffgaff and what we saw in Europe, and I think is evolving here in the U.S. is that the market of what I would describe is a hybrid market. So traditionally and this is my observation is that prepay in the U.S. market has been seen as a lesser value opportunity. In Europe, generally prepay as a way to pay and sort of the value equations, less about credit impaired and it's more about choice and control.\\nSo I think there's an opportunity for us to use prepay more as a payment choice rather than a kind of a segmentation by default. And in that is this hybrid market of people who want to have the flexibility of how they pay, want to have the flexibility of a monthly plan rather than longer, but essentially they're not what you would call traditional prepay. So that was where and some of number of the newer brands have gone into the marketplace and created a more personalized very often digitally oriented, millennial oriented, proposition and that's where it network segmentation and service segmentation can really mean you can serve that market more efficiently.\\nTimothy Horan\\nAnd obviously I don't know the numbers, I'll just make it up, but it sounds like maybe the prices were 10%, 20% lower, but your cost might have been 20%, 30% lower.\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, and that's really where you're - what I would describe as is every time margin, so you're kind of gross return after you've taken your very direct cost to either acquire and basic service. And so you could actually serve those customers at a margin that equated to your overall business even though you may be selling at a slight discount to your regular premium price.\\nTimothy Horan\\nAnd it sounds like that form of service, the churn is much lower than a traditional prepaid?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYes it is. Well, again in Europe and certainly my experience in the UK, you have an industry here that's maybe a 5% to 6% a month prepaid churn and I think 2%, 2.5%, so the sort of opportunity there is significant as well.\\nTimothy Horan\\nSo, you touched on that the networks are evolving dramatically, you're going to start to see a lot lower latency, you know obviously a lot more capacity, I think you can get better location based services with how the networks are evolving. How do you kind of charge? How do you start to think about differentiating? How you price your services and how you charge?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo I think the first thing to say is, if you look at our core business at the moment and people think about okay in the near term what are the catalysts for service revenue growth. The first thing to say is that for our customers who are coming on to the network now or for customers who are migrating in, after the early kind of optimization when we first launched unlimited, actually we are monetizing the move to unlimited, so it's actually enhancing our yield and it's accretive.\\n\\nSo we're seeing a lot more customer stepping up, so we think that the opportunity within an overall portfolio of assets is there still significant step up opportunity just for access to more data. Then I think in our case, we have very, very strong position in our core traditional segments where we have the highest value customers in the market. But as we start to segment our offer, segment the network capabilities, I think we can address the unreserved markets. And there are some segments where we have significantly below our natural share. So inside those and I'll give you a good example, three or four weeks before, we launched unlimited, we launched a 5 gig $55 plan, and some people at the time where confused as to why are you saying 5 gigs might be all you need and then three weeks later you are unlimited, 20% of my gross adds are coming on the 5 gig $55 plan.\\nSo, I think the danger is that people think it's a one size fits all. What I'm really saying is we're going exactly the opposite direction, of course the noises around unlimited, but the opportunity to develop a portfolio, which still has monetization within access and then on top of that add them to the monetization opportunity by this idea of get them so account formation and then grow on. So in an unlimited world what we see is, the propensity of people to add an additional connection whether that be a smart device, whether that be a tablet is significantly higher and that allows us to generate line access to fees twenty bucks a month.\\nSo, we're seeing inside accounts that we're continuing to grow inside the account in an unlimited world. So actually when you get to unlimited, the perception is you have no more yield in there, what we're actually seeing is continued adoption of additional lines inside those accounts, which is driving yield. And then I think the third piece is that is we add in more value added services so whether that be cloud services, whether that be hum or auto product, whether it be in the small or medium business things like our one talk service. So you will see more product feet and features that will come and sit on top of the core proposition.\\nSo really account formation then growth within the account and the one thing that I think we're recognized as being very strong add is and we will get even better is our personalization in our base, so that our record low churn is something that we will continue to focus on in the second quarter we got to 0.7% churn, which is the eighth quarter that we've been below 0.9% and while in the third quarter because of the nature of new device launches and other things will naturally see a tick up in that. I think we see an opportunity to continue to focus on below 0.9% churn, so those three will help us to drive in the short medium term our revenues.\\nTimothy Horan\\nSo you think we're on the verge where two things I guess, can the industry growth reaccelerate here as we move to unlimited, now people are kind of moving up the bucket plans, and you're adding more devices, more IoT and can you start to gain share in the market, I think you guys have lost a little bit of share last couple of years and is that is that your goal at this point?\\nRonan Dunne\\nI mean, you will be very targeted, so is it just blanket you don't have to know. I think what you'll find is it will be very focused, very forensic approach to the segments in which we're underserved and making sure that our proposition is what adds value rather than simply looking at promotional activity to drive volume. So I'm much more interested in sustainable units of revenue rather than simply a debate about a specific gross add or net add number. And I think we have a real opportunity. We have significant segments that are under penetrated or we could see ourselves picking up a number of points of share within those segments with more targeted offerings.\\n\\nAnd then as we move through to you know 4G. going into 5G world is then I think the opportunity of new services whether those that are driven by you know really low latency or the fact of being able to segment the network even more so that we can allocate traffic and services in a way that really re-dimensions the capacity that's in the network, I think that will drive a lot more new opportunity and that's where some of the IoT initiatives that are out there today are really just scratching the surface.\\nBut I give you one very practical example in business, the quality of our 4G network means that we can offer redundancy to people for their for their wireline services, so across our B2B having a 4G raptor is actually a very attractive piece of business for us, because of the strength and performance of our network, so we're actually driving a lot of incremental revenue in our B2B business for 4G can be a very effective fall back to the wireline network.\\nTimothy Horan\\nYou integrating that with software ST LAN?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, so look a lot of the where the technologies are going, the kind of interplay of the Wi-Fi and wireless world, the opportunity to create very significant bandwidth for customers. As we look into a 5G world and you think about, the download speeds and whatever that's really bandwidth, it's not single applications that are going to need that, it's more a suite of applications that may be either in the enterprise or business environment or you know home environment where you know some of the experience we've seen with unlimited is in some of the semi-rural and rural areas, is where our wireless service is substituting for high speed internet services, so that gives us an instinct that as we build out our 5G capability as we densify the network enhanced the features in the network to see around and other things we have more potential deployment opportunities.\\nTimothy Horan\\nFastening, and we've touched on it little bit right before we hit the stage, but could you - you think about or maybe how do you think about where we are in the whole wireless development of applications and used cases and maybe what might we be surprised that and how are you using the networks in 10 years?\\nRonan Dunne\\nThere's an analogy that I use I went to the BBC in London a few years ago, I met the Head of Digital there who would actually was a New Yorker and he described to me the first 10 years of television, as a radio in front of a camera. Just think about it, effectively a fixed point camera sitting watching a radio broadcast with a radio mic and individual sitting at a desk doing the radio broadcast. We are in that moment from a wireless point of view. We've seen wireless as an opportunity to have ubiquitous connectivity. We started to see digital as a way of automating on optimizing what we've always done.\\nSo move your analogue process to being other more efficient or faster through digitization. Actually we're right on the cusp of a whole series of new, new opportunities where we can - they can be game changing, you know in the IoT space we're seeing how in medical tech, the treatment of long term conditions can be really enhanced with you know the capabilities of ubiquitous connectivity, you see where agriculture is a really interesting opportunity optimization of irrigation in California is a good a good example.\\nBut we're right just on the cusp, I think of a whole load of new used cases being identified. And we did at Indianapolis 500 this year just the day before the race, we put a driver in a car, we blacked out the car completely all of the windows and we set up our 5G wireless network, and we made the driver drive with no visibility other than a head cam, which was streaming from the 5G network and they were able to run round the circuit at 60 miles an hour with no external visibility only relying on the relay coming from the 5G network, because of the virtually zero latency, they were able to drive exactly as normal.\\n\\nWhen you see that as an example, when you see the difference between 5G latency and 4G latency is a car traveling at 60 miles an hour responding their reaction time being four inches rather than four feet, and you start to get an idea of wow there are some amazing capability here and I think over the next 18, 24, 36 months you'll start to see more of those used cases coming out. So I think this is a phenomenally exciting time. The 4G LTE advanced network with carrier aggregation has a ton of more capability to go, but it's a natural segue into them into the 5G world.\\nTimothy Horan\\nGreat, great stuff. And back on the network you obviously setting up for 5G and carrier CRAN is an important part of that, where are you in the evolution to CRAN and in the 5G trials and maybe some of the timing?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, so for those of you who are familiar, we said that we would set of trials in 11 markets, we've eight of those markets set up and these are pre-commercial trials looking at a 5G fixed wireless deployment, the 5G wireless standards are probably backend of 2018, early 2019, so we're focused on the fixed wireless opportunity. And what we're looking for in the trials is just what the practical propagation experiences, the experience of self-install do you need antenna outside rather than just on the window on the inside just to see what the actual experience in the wild is.\\nSo later in the year we'll have a lot more inside, so we started with setting up those pre-commercial trials. We're now bringing on friendly customers who are actually using it and trying it out them themselves, and certainly the download speeds are very good, what we need to understand is all of the conditions the leaves on the trees you know your UPS van pulls up outside and blocks a line of sight to some of the millimeter wave spectrum, those are the sort of things that we're looking at.\\nAnd clearly with the XO acquisition and then subsequently with straight path, we have very strong position in both the 28 gigahertz and 39 gigahertz spectrum. But we're also very interested in the unlicensed spectrum of the 3.5 gig. So I think you'll start to see some evolution on the three and 3.5 gig in the shorter term and then the end of the year and early next year we'll start to get real field inside on the 3G fixed wireless experience.\\nTimothy Horan\\nAnd so far has to be playing out as you expected, I mean obviously it's experimental?\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, I think some of the propagation has probably been better, I think it's the field conditions that will ensure that it's not the what's the maximum throughput, but it's what's the minimum throughput in certain experiences, certain conditions snow heavy rain, as I said the leaves on the trees, various other things like that the line of sight, the ability for people to self-install find the optimum window and location inside.\\nSo lot of is very kind of what I would describe as low engineering tech practicalities rather than the high theoretical, because at the end of the day that's what will make this different, if you have to truck roll to install every single home and it's probably not as exciting an opportunity whereas if it's a very natural self-install then it gives us a very significant opportunity of levering the investment in fiber that we're doing at the moment, the small cell rollout that we're doing already it really gives us very natural run into the 5G space.\\nTimothy Horan\\nYeah and I've been talking a few whispers about this like you know going out to see what they actually do when they generally do put to antenna on the side of the house and it's like five times better throughput and quality as a result of that. And it's only like $100 to install the antenna it's not that big of a deal, but it does seem like works extremely well if you have the bandwidth obviously and the technologies are getting better and better all the time.\\n\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah it does, and I think like in the early stages really understanding what would need to be true to make this real alternative to some of the other while on propositions that are out there, because it's not like there isn't cable and you know fiber to the home already heavily deployed in the U.S.\\nTimothy Horan\\nAnd with the goal beat of the bundle the same with your wireless as a kind of a quad-play?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo look quad-play is an interesting thing for me, some people say what's your experience from Europe everybody went quad-play, but really interesting insight in Europe is that in markets where you have seen more bundling, it's been less customer demand driven than market structure factors. So if I take Spain versus the UK for example, when Telefonica in Spain launched their fusion bundled product. The primary driver was pay TV, 22% of households were had to pay TV service in Spain four, five years ago. In the UK at the same time it was 66%.\\nSo actually the opportunity was about for the penetration of one of the elements of the bundle that wasn't. What customers tend to identify is that in competitive markets in the U.S. is one, and if you've got real choice in the individual products, then the cost of bundling is that you end up taking the second best wireless product, and you map it to the third best TV bundle in order to get the cheapest broadband connection or fiber connection. No wonder you get five bucks offer the end of the bill, so I think from our point of view is focusing on being the preeminent wireless carrier in the marketplace is a very, very strong play in the market and so give the customers real choice, and I think as we broaden out our segmentation and broaden out our proposition makes that will allow us to do that even more effectively.\\nTimothy Horan\\nGood point. On the other - when will 5G for mobile be available do you think? I know we can fix replacement trial.\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo I think, I think there will be two critical things, there is the lockdown of standards and look I'm not an expert in this, but whether you know the Chinese want to go for a separate standard whether they want to roll in and being part of that will be will be a factor. And then the critical thing is from a technology and engineering point of view or make one commitment will be first we have been in every generation of technology, and we will, what I think ultimately is important is when you come first is how you influence the way the industry sets up, you have to define the rules by which the industry plays.\\nI think the second piece is when will there be devices the form factor of mobile devices that will allow for a wider adoption. If I take LTE for a moment and LTE is taken way over 90% of our data traffic in the U.S., but it's only in the mid 50% of our voice traffic, because actually voice over LTE came a little later it was one of the pieces of the standards that was actually fixed a little later in the LTE standard setting. So while it's growing significantly not all of our 4G devices out there supports voice over LTE. So what you see is it's the phases of adoption, so maybe late 2018 for the standard setting, but maybe than a little while later before you start to see available devices, attractive devices we can form factor that you know competitive.\\nTimothy Horan\\nSo I can talk to a few more hours, but we only have like four minutes, so any question here. Any mic out here?\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nQ - Unidentified Analyst\\nTwo questions. This is for Ronan.\\nRonan Dunne\\nYeah, yeah.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nFirst of all, what I would call of the new AT&T when they start to roll out FirstNet how do you compete with that since in a sense they could be ubiquitous across the country?\\nRonan Dunne\\n\\nSo let me take that first and maybe second one coming. So the first thing I would say is that we are the number one supplier to the public service and public safety in the U.S. We have an exceptionally strong both the reputation and relationships in that space, and the one thing that we're saying we are responding to RFPs and states that are considering their opt-in, opt-out strategy every day. We're working very closely with our customers to make sure that we continue to position ourselves to be an effective provider of services right across the public service and specifically in public safety.\\nSo we're able to already leverage significantly greater coverage in the U.S. than FirstNet would have access to somewhere in the region of about 700,000 square miles of additional coverage, so that's a really important consideration. So we're very focused, we're not going away when it comes to public service and public safety we will be competing very strongly for all of that business and we think the capabilities of our network and the coverage of our network means that we actually have more to offer today than an alternative.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nAnd my second question is as a senior officer of your parent what greater integration and cost savings do you see of bringing wireless under the umbrella completely?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo I think the question clearly since the early 2014 we're all part of 100% owned by Verizon Communications, I think where I would focus is, there are opportunity for us to be even more cost effective inside the wireless business, and I think the network strategy that we've annunciated and bringing Hans Vestberg into the organization gives a very clear signal to the fact that we see real synergy in the way we build out infrastructure. The truth is the world is going wireless, but the reality of a wireless network is it needs a very strong fiber and capability underneath to support.\\nSo we're very much in our one network, one fiber strategy that will ensure that we get real optimization. So the investments we're making to support our enterprise customers today are also supporting the rollout of wireless small cells in urban locations, and we have a very clear line of sight how what we deploy today is supporting not just 4G LTE, but is also enabling our 5G capability in due course.\\nAnd then I think the second part of driving cost is really around the areas of automation, the use of artificial intelligence machine learning where I think we can significantly reduce the cost to serve while at the same time enhancing the quality of experience.\\nTimothy Horan\\nNext one over here.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nCould you talk a little bit about your strategy with as it pertains the CAT-M, IoT and what your vision is of how that's going to roll out over the next 12, 24, 36 months in the opportunity there for you for Verizon?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo look, the first thing I will say is not an area of my subject expertise, what I would say is in our in our enterprise space this is part of what I would describe as the segmentation and solutions orientation. So we've set up our enterprise business with a very clear focus on core segments and looking at areas like health, like agriculture and others and seeing where these IoT opportunities are. We also see in the telematics space with global auto being one of the big drivers.\\nBut we've also seen the drive of regulation more recently the requirements of people to have in cab recording of usage and driving is also creating some very short term relevant opportunities. So we see significant growth there, what I would say to you is some of the early used cases are looking positive. I think we probably need a broader set of used cases and that's why we're working very closely with certain industry sectors to really work closely with key clients in those areas to say look where does your strategy need you to be in five years' time. A number of the drivers have been regulatory ones in the shorter term you know pharmaceuticals and then being tracked around the U.S. truck monitoring and stuff like that. I think there's more at B to B and B to B solutions that will be relevant in some key segments. I think health, pharma, I think agriculture probably strong ones, transportation more broadly.\\n\\nTimothy Horan\\nAnd what is your IoT growing right now in your business?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo couple of $100 million quarter and it's a double digit growth business, and I think the play there is getting the balance between volume and value there are some things where what we will do is, we will see the volume, so with that adoption a lot of SIMs which overtime will then generate lot more revenue. So just in the mix I think it's a combination of SIMs deployed and the higher value add services. And our telematics business is a great example in some cases, we get the transport, in some cases like Mercedes Benz in the U.S. when I drive one of those cars in the whole suite of services that's coming is actually coming via Verizon. So that's you know it's not a 10 X, it's more like 100 X yield per vehicle in comparison to just carrying the transport.\\nTimothy Horan\\nAnd do you like that service?\\nRonan Dunne\\nIt's a great service and I think there's a general theme is that you know 4G is starting to make happen to 5G will, the real play it's not just ubiquitous connectivity, it's standing up information contextually whenever and wherever you are that's the thing when we go to things like VR augmented reality, when you look at some of these services, it's all about making sure that you have access it's your personal cloud, you have access to relevant information, so that you can make decisions which are real time contextual decisions, because you have the best information. That's the really exciting thing about this. We process 60 billion pieces of information every single day.\\nTimothy Horan\\nSo last question, are you working with your content counterparts, AOL, Yahoo are they going to help kind of with the information gathering and processing and evolution?\\nRonan Dunne\\nSo I'll break it into two parts. We have some very good big data and small data capabilities inside Verizon. We have significantly augmented those with the acquisition of Yahoo, they have some real strong capability there. And then the second thing I would say is for Tim's business, his audience is global more than a billion, so he has an opportunity to help me in my business and I have an opportunity to help him, but it's not his business, is not solely dependent on the wireless business, because he has a much broader global audience.\\nWhere we do see opportunities though is engagement with the portfolio of really interesting assets the Yahoo Sport, Yahoo Finance, those areas are really strong inside Yahoo, and then are focused on sports with our go 90 proposition with our NFL or NBA. We will start to build experiences for our Verizon customers, which are more immersive by being able to bring the experiences that Yahoo offers plus our sponsorship engagement on the content we have on that and bring those together to give a broader more engaging experience around sport, around personal, finance around news. So I'm very excited about that and I think we'll be able to tell a more personal offers to our customers as well.\\nTimothy Horan\\nGreat job Ronan and good luck. Thanks for coming.\\nRonan Dunne\\nOkay, it's my pleasure. Thank you.\\nTimothy Horan\\nThanks everybody.\", '/article/4091322-verizon-communications-vz-q2-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript': \"Verizon Communications, Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nThanks, Eunice. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.\\nBefore I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.\\nBefore Matt goes through the results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $1.07 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax gain of about $1.8 billion. This net gain consists primarily of the sale of certain data centers to Equinix.\\nWe also incurred pre-tax severance charges of $607 million and acquisition and integrated related charges of $152 million, primarily in connection with the closing of our acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets, which we previously disclosed. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $458 million, or $0.11 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.96 in the second quarter, compared to $0.94 a year ago. As a reminder, last year's adjusted earnings per share included $0.07 from the impact of the work stoppage.\\nAlso, our consolidated results for the second quarter included one month of data center operations that we sold to Equinix on May 1, 2017, and about two weeks of Yahoo operations. We have posted unaudited historical wireline segment results, which recast the segment for the impact of the sale to Equinix on our website.\\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\n\\nThanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter of execution. First, we invested in our 4G network leadership position, resulting in a sweep of third-party network performance surveys for the first half of 2017, while prepositioning for 5G services. Second, we delivered solid wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment with an increase in both postpaid and prepaid accounts. Third, we successfully completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets to scale our media business.\\nNetwork leadership is the central element of our strategy, and we are continually investing in our network to extend our leadership in 4G capacity growth with densification using small cells, which includes expanding our fiber capabilities. As we prepare for the network of the future, we announced the acquisition of Straight Path for $3.1 billion, which we expect will close by the end of first quarter 2018. Straight Path complements our spectrum portfolio and positions us to lead and further drive 5G technology and its ecosystem. We have begun the precommercial fixed wireless trials in eight out of the 11 markets and have our first batch of customers on this technology. As we have previously highlighted, we will have trial results later in the year, and I look forward to sharing them with you.\\nWe had a strong quarter, adding and retaining wireless customers as the momentum from the launch of our unlimited plans was sustained throughout the quarter. We delivered a strong wireless operational performance that reflects customer demand for our high-quality network in a highly competitive market. Finally, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and immediately began executing on integration plans that we've been working on for over a year. We are confident in the execution of our strategy, which we expect to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows, and return long-term value to our shareholders.\\nLet's go deeper into the second quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by wireless and wireline results, media and telematics progress, and network and technology updates.\\nNow on to slide 6. In the second quarter, total operating revenue was in line with last year. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined 2.0%. The primary driver was the decrease in wireless service revenue, which was consistent with our expectation. On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.2%. We remain focused on improving our overall cost structure through operating efficiencies across network, distribution, and care. As we shift more transactions toward a digital model, we can improve the customer experience and further enhance operating efficiencies.\\nLet's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 7. Our operating segments continue to generate substantial cash flows. During the first half of 2017, cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.9 billion and included a net after-tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion. Our high-quality cash generation is driven by the diverse base of wireless and wireline customers. Our ongoing asset-backed securitization program provided $2.9 billion of cash, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The impact of the transition to device payment plans and on-balance-sheet securitization should approach a steady state around the end of 2017. Thereafter, the sequential impacts will primarily reflect seasonality of new device launches. As a result, we expect the working capital headwind to subside in 2018.\\nFor the first half of the year, capital spending was $7.0 billion, which was in line with last year. On a year-to-date basis, our reported free cash flow of $2.9 billion includes the discretionary pension contribution net of tax of $2.1 billion, which flowed through our cash flow from operations. In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset-backed securitization, which was introduced in the third quarter of last year.\\n\\nOur balance sheet is solid and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $117.5 billion of total debt, which comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on-balance-sheet securitizations. We have not changed our capital allocation plan or our expectation for cash availability, and we remain focused on having a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders.\\nNow let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with wireless on slide 8. In a highly competitive wireless environment, we delivered a strong operational performance, protecting and expanding our high-valued postpaid customer relationships while balancing profitability. With a clear and comparable offer, our value proposition highlighted the strength of our network, resulting in industry-leading customer retention and improved new demand during the quarter as our offer appealed to customers in underpenetrated segments.\\nWireless operational performance was sustained throughout the second quarter, building on the customer momentum at the end of the first quarter with improvements in both sequential and year-over-year net phone add performance. Net phone additions were 358,000, compared to 86,000 in the prior year. Smartphone net additions were 590,000, versus 336,000 last year. Postpaid net adds totaled 614,000, including tablet net adds of 2,000 and other connected devices of 254,000, led by Verizon Wireless retail home devices. We added 64,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 83,000 last year, and we grew our postpaid account base for the first time in the past six quarters.\\nOur postpaid phone churn reflects customer demand for network quality and reliability, while pricing provided choices to meet customer needs. Postpaid phone churn not only continued recent trends below 0.9% but also established a new low in the LTE era at 0.70%. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.94% was consistent year over year and down 21 basis points sequentially. Total postpaid device activations were up 3.0%, of which 82% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.6%, up from 5.4% year over year, and was 43 basis points higher sequentially. During the quarter, 6.2 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid net adds of 19,000 were up year over year and sequentially due to our stronger value proposition.\\nLet's turn to slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 1.9% in the second quarter as compared to a 5.1% decline in the first quarter. Service revenue declined 6.7% versus a 6.1% decrease in the previous quarter. This trend was primarily due to the lost overage revenue driven by plans introduced during summer of 2016 and the introductory unlimited offer. As we discussed during our last earnings call, we expected weaker year-over-year service revenue through the first half of the year, primarily due to line access and overage revenue trends.\\nAt the end of the second quarter, about 59% of our accounts have tools that offer customers the ability to self-manage their usage experience. During the second quarter, we experienced an improvement in the rate of decline in line access revenue, as we now have roughly 75% of the postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans. We expect this trend will continue which, combined with adding new accounts and migrating customers to higher access points, will mitigate the lost overage revenue. Therefore, we believe the service revenue trend has flattened, and we expect that there will be an improving trend in the second half, and we should exit the fourth quarter inside a decline of 4.0%.\\n\\nIn the second quarter, equipment revenue increased 16%. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, as compared to approximately 76% in the first quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan at the end of the quarter. Our wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 45.8%. The movement in the service revenue trend will also positively impact wireless EBITDA margin.\\nLet's move next to our wireline segment on slide 10. Total wireline revenue on a reported basis grew 1.2%, including the recently acquired XO operations. On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.8% compared to a decline of 3.2% last quarter. This shift in the wireline revenue trend towards fiber is growing. Organically, fiber based products grew more than 3%, which supports our plans to further invest in fiber. Our emphasis on delivering value to all business customers, from the very small to the large enterprise, was recognized recently in a leading third-party study. More importantly, we won the large enterprise business award for the second consecutive year in the same study.\\nConsumer markets revenue increased 0.6%, driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue growth of 4.1% was consistent with the past several quarters. During the quarter, we launched Fios Gigabit Connection in certain markets, which offers symmetrical speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. In Fios Internet, we added 49,000 customers. Fios Video results were pressured due to softer secular demand for traditional linear video, given growth in the over-the-top offerings, as well as competitive promotional activity. Fios Video losses were 15,000 in the quarter. For the second quarter, Enterprise Solutions revenue fell 4.1% on an organic basis, which was due to persistent trends in our legacy products and pricing compression in the marketplace. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 3.5%.\\nPartner Solutions revenue declined 6.8% on an organic basis, while the revenue mix towards fiber has been trending higher. Within business markets, fiber revenue is expanding, driven by Fios broadband demand, offset by continued pressure in legacy products. On an organic basis, revenue declined 4.9% and improved slightly sequentially.\\nOn a comparable basis, the second quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 20.8%, compared to 13.3%, which included the work stoppage, last year. Sequentially, wireline EBITDA margin was down 120 basis points, primarily due to lower revenue from Enterprise Solutions and Partner Solutions and an increase in operating expense as a result of leasing data center space related to the sale to Equinix.\\nLet's move next to slide 11 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. On June 13, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets. Upon closing, we launched Oath, which is a combination of AOL and Yahoo brands, serving approximately 1 billion unique monthly users globally, and currently represents about $7 billion in annual revenue. We have been planning the integration of AOL and Yahoo for the past year and immediately began executing on integration plans upon closing. We expect to realize over $1 billion in cumulative operating expense synergies through 2020.\\nWe are in the very early stages of leveraging the scale of the combined assets to distribute and monetize content through programmatic advertising across our Sports, Finance, News, and Entertainment properties. These properties will provide unique advertising opportunities to targeted global audiences. Organically, AOL's revenue net of traffic acquisition costs was consistent with prior year's results in the quarter. As the integration progresses, we will provide additional information on the Oath business. Organically, IoT revenue, including telematics, increased approximately 20% in the second quarter. Telematics revenue was approximately $220 million in the quarter.\\n\\nLet's move next to slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our wireless and wireline assets to ensure that we have capacity, reduce the cost to serve, and to preposition the networks for the future. Our value proposition to our wireless customers is to provide a full network experience including reliability, coverage, and speed. We are on our wireless network plan to deliver the industry's best overall experience for our customers.\\nOur network experience continues to be recognized by multiple third-party studies as the industry leader. Since the launch of unlimited, two of these studies have reconfirmed our network leadership in overall performance, including speed and voice quality over LTE. As expected, the introduction of the unlimited pricing plan increased the LTE network usage as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day on the industry-leading wireless network. We are confident in our network and have been engineering the network based on a long-term integrated plan to extend our high-quality experience while expanding our value proposition to customers. We remain focused on delivering increasing capacity over the long-term, utilizing a three-pronged approach: first, network features; second, densification; and, third, spectrum. Let's discuss each of these in detail.\\nFirst, we are methodically deploying LTE Advanced features to increase capacity on our network resources and align with the timing of smartphone introductions that can take advantage of these features.\\nSecond, small cells are playing a vital role in creating capacity. The densification efforts have been a focal point of our network strategy over the past several years. This density also creates increased spectral efficiency and offers the best wireless experience.\\nFinally, with nearly all of our network traffic now on the 4G LTE Advanced network, we are utilizing just over 50% of our low and mid-band spectrum portfolio for this network. We expect to use more of our PCS spectrum for LTE and are just beginning to redeploy 850 megahertz spectrum in certain markets. In addition, we are deploying AWS-3 and will start to add unlicensed spectrum later this year. Our spectrum deployments in conjunction with multicarrier aggregation technology are enabling us to increase network capacity. Our overall wireless network integrates features, densification, and spectrum to enable a step function increase in wireless network capacity over the long term.\\nFiber is a critical element in transforming both wireless and wireline networks to reduce costs and expand future capabilities. To enhance this strategy, our recent announcements to secure fiber demonstrates our commitment to increase our multiuse fiber footprint and build fiber deeper into the network. On the 5G wireless front, we are up and running in eight out of the 11 precommercial fixed wireless broadband trials on the millimeter-wave spectrum. We have the first batch of customers on the network. We will have trial results towards the end of the year that will give us valuable insights for commercial deployments.\\nLet's move next to slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. We are executing on our plan to lead in network, preserve and grow our customer relationships, and expand our presence in digital media and telematics to deliver fundamental results while allocating capital to continue to invest in our operations and return value to our shareholders. We delivered strong wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment. We evolved our wireless value proposition while driving profitable growth and reconfirming network leadership based on third-party study results. We expect that we will create incremental capital and operational efficiencies that result in additional cash generation.\\n\\nOur 5G strategy is progressing for fixed and mobility use cases, standards, spectrum resources, and fiber investments. Now that we have completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and introduced the Oath brand, our media business is focused on the integration plans, and we'll look to increase engagement on our platforms. In telematics, we see additional growth opportunities with our Fleetmatics and Telogis assets. We remain confident in our strategy, which puts us in a strong position to compete today and into the future while delivering long-term value to our shareholders.\\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nThank you, Matt. Eunice, we're now ready to take questions.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. Your first question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\\nMichael I. Rollins - Citi Research\\nHi, good morning. Two questions if I could. One, I'm curious if you could delve a little bit further into the competitive environment. Last earnings call you provided a perspective of the how net adds and gross adds flowed over the quarter. I was wondering if you could do the same thing just so we could frame what was driving the improvement in your performance this quarter on the phone add out of the equation. And then secondly, just on 5G, if you can give us an update where you are with the trials and maybe if you have an update on the economics that you're seeing from those deployments. Thanks.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nThanks, Mike. Appreciate the question. So on the competitive environment through the quarter, I would say we saw it – outperformance in the quarter was pretty even. You saw the churn number; we came in at 0.70%. That certainly contributed to the net adds and shows that once we had a comparable offer out there against the competition, I mean, by being unlimited where the other guys are unlimited. Even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver, and we saw that throughout the quarter.\\nSo even as we headed into the back end of the quarter and the competitive environment picked up and some of the other offers that came out there, whether that be large bounties to switch carrier or offering free service, our performance in the back end of the quarter was consistent with where we saw it in the first part of the quarter. So we saw a great result from customers on both the gross adds side and the loyalty side once they had that comparable offer to do. So very excited about how that played out.\\nAs we head forward, second quarter is typically, seasonally, the low quarter for churn. So while we certainly expect churn to continue to be at low levels, we'll see if we get a normal seasonal uptick as we go forward. But from a competitive environment standpoint, I think we showed that we competed throughout the quarter without having to put any aggressive promotions in place in the market at any time during the quarter.\\nIn terms of 5G, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, we now have the trials up and running. It's going to be later in the year before we start to see results out of those trials. And then, in terms of the business model and economics that may come of that, it will be driven by the results we see from the trials. So too early right now to be more definitive on that, but we're still confident that we'll have a commercial product in market during 2018 and look forward to providing more details on what's coming out of the trials and the overall economics that we see when we get into the latter part of the year.\\n\\nMichael I. Rollins - Citi Research\\nThanks very much.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nOkay, thanks, Mike. Eunice, next question, please?\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC\\nHey, guys, thanks. First, can we talk about your small cell rollout? Where are we in the path of that? I know it's a multiyear effort, but how far are we into the small cell rollout and densification? And, second, can you talk about the competitive environment in video and broadband? As you add up the OTT trends and traditional video losses, do you see an acceleration in cord cutting, or does it just seem like customers are spreading out among more video service providers? Thanks.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nYeah. Thanks, Phil. Good morning. So on the small cell rollout, we're exactly where we planned to be. I mean, our capital plan for the year, we're right on where we planned to be at the start of the year. And we are now – I would say we have small cell builds in all of the top metro markets at this point, and that's one of the reasons we have the network performance that we've had. We saw confirmation of that as recently as yesterday with another one of the third-party surveys that proves that during the first quarter of 2017, even once we were on unlimited, our network performs better than anybody else's, and that's in large part due to what we've been doing for the past number of years on small cell densification.\\nI know you hear a lot of other people talk a lot about small cell densification now. Remember that we've been doing that for a longer time period than anyone else, and that's why we're in all of the top metro markets. And we will continue to do that. That will be a continued part of our network capacity plan. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have the long-term network plan that's based off continuing to deploy the spectrum that we own against the LTE network, densification, and the LTE tools that are available. So densification continues to be a very important part of our network plan.\\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC\\nIs there a point, Matt, at -\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nFrom a competitive environment (28:09) in the broadband and TV space, I think what you saw is we had a continued strong performance on the broadband side, but we also see the ongoing secular trend around video. So we continue to add high-quality broadband customers and will continue to compete on the video side, but certainly we do that in the face of the secular trends that are ongoing.\\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC\\nIs there a point, Matt, at which the small cell densification effort sort of starts to slow down in a few years, or is this a constant effort for the next three, five years?\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nI think it continues. It's not just around 4G, as we've talked in the past. As we see 5G being deployed on millimeter-wave spectrum, that's going to require a small cell deployment, and so as we put the densification in place of 4G, we're doing it in mind knowing that we've got the 5G that will be using the same dark fiber in other assets. So the densification activity will continue here for a good number of years.\\nPhilip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC\\nThanks, Matt.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nEunice, next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\\nJohn C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC\\nOkay, thanks. Matt, maybe can we get some more color on a couple of the forward-looking sort of items you gave us on the wireless side? First on the service revenue. It was down 6.7%, but you said that it would start to sort of flatten in the second half. And then the 4% sort of year-end exit run rate. Can I assume we're looking at something around 6.7% for the third quarter and then improvement, something in the sort of 5% range for the fourth quarter? Just if you could put some color there.\\n\\nAnd then some similarly on the margins. You said as the service revenue improves we'd see some improvement in the margins. Total margins in wireless have been down a little bit in the first half, you know in each quarter. Are you sort of suggesting it'll be down less in the second half? Or do you think that as we see the improvement into the year, obviously, there's some crosscurrents with the new phone, but could we get back up flat or even positive comps on the margin? Thanks.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nYeah. Thanks, John. So on the service revenue, I think consistent with what we said earlier in the year, we see second quarter as being the low point and the 6.7% for 2Q will become something better then in 3Q. And in my prepared remarks I believe I – you heard me say that we'll be inside of negative 4% in the fourth quarter. So in terms of how do we get there, we talked about that 75% of the base in second quarter was on unsubsidized pricing. That compares to 53% a year ago. So there's north of a 20-point movement from second quarter last year to second quarter this year.\\nAs you get into the back half of the year – I'll use fourth quarter as an example. Fourth quarter year-ago, that number was 67%. This year, that number is going top out in the upper 70s. So we're at 75% now. We'll get up to, let's say, 77%. That will only be a 10-point delta in the fourth quarter year over year. So that pressure that's come from taking customers from the subsidized model down to the unsubsidized pricing is starting to wane, and really the second quarter is where we reached the point, we've got essentially the vast majority of the consumer base now on unsubsidized pricing.\\nAnd then overage revenues also being, obviously, part of the story here over the past few quarters, first with the introduction of the price plans last year that had the Safety Mode feature and then bringing on unlimited. As we said, we now have 59% of accounts on one of those two plans. Overage was actually down 34% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. Now represents a low single digit percentage part of total service revenues. So we're working through that headwind. We'll work through that headwind a lot faster. And so, as I say, based off that, I am very confident we'll be inside negative 4% in fourth quarter, and by the time we get on this call a year from now and our comparison is against this year being 75% on unsubsidized pricing, we'll be having a very different conversation about the service revenue trajectory next year.\\nAnd then on margin improvement, as you know, service revenue is the highest margin component of our business, so as the trajectory on service revenue improves, the trajectory on margin will improve as well.\\nJohn C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC\\nOkay. Thanks, Matt.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nEunice, next question, please?\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\\nDavid Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\\nHey, guys, thanks a lot. I guess two if I could. I just wanted to follow up on that service revenue question, Matt. I mean, the math kind of suggests that by fourth quarter your service revenue will actually be growing from where it is in the second quarter. And I wonder if you could kind of talk about the inputs to that expectation in terms of kind of what you expect from a competitive pricing environment, promotions with the iPhone, et cetera, relative to that mix shift that you've been talking about, as you kind of go past the price down cohort and you move into this group of people that are kind of more pricing up. If you could talk about those two dynamics as kind of the inputs as your base case, would be helpful.\\n\\nAnd then the second question, if I could, would be on the media segment. I mean, if you could kind of elaborate a little bit more on what is that thing growing at today and what will it look like in the future? I guess we've talked about maybe turning down the search business and how that business might transform over the next six months or year, would kind of be helpful to kind of understand what that unit is going to look like. Thanks.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nYeah, good morning, David. Thank you. So the inputs to service revenue. Really as you think about that trajectory changing, when you've got growing accounts, growing net adds, when you see the continued improvement in the delta on the non-subsidized pricing and as we work through the overage, all of that will combine to a much stronger trend as we go forward from where we have been.\\nIn terms of the impact of any new devices coming along, look, we assume that we'll see something later in the year. We typically have very strong results when we have new devices come out because when customers get a new device with new functions, they want it on the best network, but we'll see what happens there. And certainly would expect that to be accretive to the overall revenue story.\\nBut our guidance for the year doesn't require any major uplift as a result of that. And then the media side, look, I will say it was very early in the process of integrating those two businesses. As we said, the revenue of AOL less TAC was flat year over year in the quarter. Tim and the team are just getting started integrating those two businesses. They're about 45 days in at this point. The integration is going well, and I look forward to being able to provide more color and commentary about exactly what they're seeing as they go forward. But as you heard Tim say a couple of months ago, the goal here is to grow this to north of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, and nothing that's happened since we closed has changed our view on that.\\nDavid Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\\nAll right. Thanks, Matt.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nEunice, next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.\\nThanks. A question for Matt. And if I'm reading your guidance correctly, it seems like you effectively reiterated your outlook for the year, including what implies roughly a flattish EPS trend. There were a few moving parts this quarter. You did the Equinix data enter deal, and I think that may have been slightly dilutive to earnings. And, of course, you completed the acquisition of Yahoo. So I was hoping maybe you could just unpack your outlook for the full year and maybe let us know the extent to which those transactions may have been accretive or dilutive to your trends for the balance of 2017. Thanks.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nYeah. Thanks, Brett. So the guide, if you look at the language on the revenue side, we said we'd be reasonably consistent on an organic basis. So as we think about that, we would remove out anything that wasn't in the business for all of 2016-2017. So certainly the impact of those businesses have been having about $0.02 a quarter on EPS, so when I think about the guide going forward, it's on an organic basis. Still feel very confident organically we'll be in a consistent place to where we were a year ago, and then we'll bake in the impact of the various acquisitions as we go forward.\\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.\\nSo does that imply that it's actually additive to your full-year outlook? (37:25)\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nAs we get into each of those businesses, certainly from a revenue standpoint they are additive to the outlook. From an earnings standpoint, some of those businesses have an initial pressure as we integrate them, but not material to the earnings outlook.\\n\\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.\\nAnd then just a different question. As we think about unlimited, and you were talking about doing more digital customer interactions and customer care, have you already started to see a benefit there? In other words, as your customer base has moved to unlimited plans, is that cohort contacting you less frequently? And could this be a real area of offset to some of the overage that you're losing on the top line?\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, certainly with customers on unlimited they have fewer reasons to call. But we continue to want to improve the customer experience, and when customers can do things by themselves through a digital channel at the time they want to do it, that increases overall satisfaction, and it certainly allows us to improve the efficiency of the business. So we're continuing to do that, and we think unlimited certainly helps us do that as well.\\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nEunice, next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC\\nHi, thank you. Matt, I wonder if we could return to the network densification conversation you had a few moments ago. Can you talk about how you think about the trade-off specifically between acquiring more spectrum and network densification, and from an economics perspective, and has that shifted at all inside of Verizon? I mean, my sense is you're much different than a year or so ago. You spend less time talking about new spectrum acquisition. Is that a fair characterization?\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nLook, we continue to look at that trade-off. It really comes down to taking a view on the most efficient way to add the capacity that we need, and we've talked for two or three years now about the fact that we believe based off of the valuations that spectrum have reached in some places, it's more efficient to densify. And certainly the costs of densification, just like with any technology, have come down to some degree since we started densifying with small cell. So the overall analysis we do hasn't fundamentally changed. Look, we continue to add spectrum from the secondary markets, too. So when spectrum is priced at the right level, we continue to be active in that space, too. And we just look at the relative economics between densifying and adding spectrum. But densification has proved to be a very effective way of adding capacity into what places we need to and from a cost efficiency standpoint as well.\\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC\\nThanks, Matt, and if I could just ask a quick follow-up. I'm going to risk putting words in your mouth, but is it fair to say that you still believe, broadly speaking, that network advantage is still possible and within reach for Verizon with the network densification strategy?\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nLook, I think the results speak for themselves on this one, Craig, and whether it be the third-party results that you've seen, again, just in the last 24 hours. But even in an unlimited world, the third-party results clearly show that Verizon has the best network. And then when you look at our subscriber metrics for the quarter, once we were on a comparable basis, we saw record low churn down 0.70%, and we also saw a strong net add number. So the idea that network differentiation doesn't matter to customers – quite frankly, the results from our base show that that's not true and customers do value the benefit of a differentiated network experience even when it's at a premium pricing, which is where ours is. We wouldn't get those results if a better network experience didn't matter to customers. Clearly it does.\\n\\nCraig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC\\nThank you.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nEunice, next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\\nMichael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC\\nHey, guys, thanks. Matt, maybe just a little deeper on the churn that we saw in the quarter – obviously a very strong result there. Is it an impact from more EIP customers and sort of the equipment balances keeping people steady? Was there anything you guys were doing with respect to protecting the base with maybe proactively moving to unsubsidized without the EIP payments? And then just following up again on the guide on service revenue, what's the more important driver here for the year? Is it handset additions maintaining sort of a positive posture, or is it the ARPA starting to turn? Or, obviously, it could be a combination of both.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nYeah. Thanks, Mike. So on the churn, look, there's no magic in here. It's not that we've got more customers on EIP or we've been doing things behind the scenes to protect the base. It's around the quality of the experience. And customers see that quality of the experience, and they want to be on that experience rather than something else. So we're very, very happy with that number there, and it's just a reflection of what we give customers.\\nIn terms of the guide on service revenue, I think the biggest piece that you have in there is the continued migration of the base to the non-subsidized pricing plans. In the back half of the year, the year-over-year comps are against higher numbers there versus the first half of the year, and that's going to drive improvement in service revenue. Certainly net account growth is an important contribution, but I think just, though, the movement of the base and in unsubsidized, that's the trend we've been talking about, and we certainly see that ahead of us.\\nMichael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC\\nAnd, Matt, maybe just a quick follow-up on thoughts on towers. I know one of your – your biggest competitor, I guess, is looking for alternatives. Are you guys also evaluating some of those things?\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nWe continue to look at all ways to manage the network at the most efficient pricing that we have, whether that be how we talk to towers or all the other resources we have in front of us.\\nMichael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC\\nGreat, thanks, Matt.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nEunice, next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\\nJennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\\nThank you for taking the question. Matt, if I may, on the spectrum side, I know you've talked much about densification, but you did mention other spectrum sources. It looks like there's going to be a 3.5 gigahertz auction possibly next year. And it seems like Verizon's done much lobbying for that effort. In your spectrum kind of wish list, is it fair to say you're probably more focused on higher-band spectrum at this point? Or if you could comment on that.\\nAnd then second, if I may, on the One Fiber initiative, it's certainly early to call 2018 CapEx, but do you still feel comfortable that, with the fiber plans you've laid out, or some which we know about, some we probably don't, that that really won't be a huge increase in the CapEx lever next year? Thanks.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nThanks, Jennifer. So on the spectrum wish list, look, we're very confident in the portfolio of spectrum that we have, certainly in low band and mid-band, and we have a significant amount of spectrum still to deploy against the LTE network. We'd certainly be interested in the 3.5 [gigahertz] and look forward to that coming forward, but as I say, we're very confident in the spectrum that we still have to deploy.\\n\\nFrom a CapEx standpoint next year, look, it's too early to get into the guide next year, but as we think about how we deploy fiber and so on, that will be part of the plans, and we'll share those as we get towards the latter part of the year and certainly into January, when we provide the full-year guide.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nOkay. Jennifer, thank you. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\\nThanks a lot. Good morning. Matt, you talked a little bit about some of the pressures in the video business from over-the-top. How is Verizon thinking about that opportunity? Is there a case for you to have your own over-the-top product to compete? And how do you think – I know on convergence you've typically been conservative, but we're seeing a lot more of these converged wireless plus over-the-top offerings. And maybe just touching, then, on M&A and what your interest is in potentially owning more content to have some exclusive product for your customers. Thanks.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nThanks for the question, Simon. So on over-the-top, look, nothing to say. We're always looking, but we'll continue to evaluate what we need to do to be competitive in that space and if it needs to be part of the portfolio or not. From a convergence standpoint, again, we're very comfortable with the product offerings we have today, and if there is more convergence, we certainly believe that will take place on our networks, and we'll be effective as being part of that.\\nAnd then from an M&A standpoint, look, we're very comfortable with the assets we have today. If there's an opportunity to add something that accelerates the strategy at a reasonable price, we will. But we think we have the assets we need to be effective at this point in time.\\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\\nGreat. Thank you.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nEunice, next question, please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.\\nThank you very much. I was wondering if we could touch upon sort of that network focus and the most efficient means to build additional capacity. When we think about your fiber footprint, you folks have certainly augmented it via acquisitions as well as some of the announcements that you've made to build out capacity. Where does it stand at this juncture in terms of not just the fiber footprint itself, but having the right type of fiber assets to deploy 5G? And how do you expect to augment that capacity going forward?\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nYeah, thank you. So as we think about the fiber we need for the business, certainly we need more going forward, as we've discussed in the past. The way that we're going to add that capacity will be probably through a combination of buying fiber that already exists if it's the right type of fiber. We can build fiber, and we can certainly lease. And we were doing that on top of some of the assets we already own, and add in the XO, those fiber metro rings earlier in the year gives us the base on which we will continue to do some of that. So fiber will continue to be very important the higher we build the network, not just for wireless but also various wireline applications, including Smart City deployments. So more to come there as we go forward.\\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.\\nThat's very helpful, Matt. And then just dovetailing on the prior commentary on over-the-top, just want to try and put those comments that you had made in terms of evaluating options with some of the comments that seem to have been made previously about you folks putting together an offering. I mean, has that changed in terms of timing or what your strategy is for over-the-top?\\n\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nI'd say there's no change to our strategy at this point in time.\\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.\\nExcellent. Thanks very much for the incremental color.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nGreat. Eunice, we'll take one more question, please, and then we'll wrap up.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\\nGreat, guys, and thanks, guys, and congratulations on a good quarter. Matt, the unlimited side, and incredible impact here, do you think this is sustainable? Are you seeing any slowdown at all? Maybe – I'm not sure if you said on the call – what percentage of your base are on unlimited or maybe a flow share.\\nAnd then not to pound you on wireless margins, but it sounded like you kind of expect them to trend up for the next several years, not just for this quarter. Do you think we can get back to, on a consolidated basis, the type of margins we saw last year or even better than that? And I guess just lastly how do you balance out the growth in subscribers with the margins that you're generating which are still, obviously, industry-leading? Thanks.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nYeah. Thanks, Tim. So, look, I absolutely think the trend on unlimited is sustainable. Once we gave customers that clear and comparable offer, we see the value of our network and our offering compared to what else is in the marketplace. And, look, we'll see how the marketplace evolves going forward. But we're very confident that we will be competitive as that happens.\\nFrom a margin improvement standpoint, look, as service revenue trends improve, we would expect that to flow through into margins. And then also we continue to have ways to take cost out of the business and improve efficiencies in the business, too. So you should think about that as you think about how we go forward in the wireless performance.\\nTimothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\\nThank you.\\nMichael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nOkay, great. And with that, I'd like to just turn the call back over to Matt on this busy earning morning.\\nMatthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.\\nThanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. We remain confident in our strategy of investing in our networks while maintaining and expanding our high-quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We are well-positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry in the 5G ecosystem with our strong network assets. We have the opportunity to do the things at scale while delivering value across our portfolio in order to generate shareholder value. We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us and are confident in our ability to execute our strategy. Thank you for your time today.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.\", '/article/4074150-verizons-vz-management-moffettnathanson-4th-annual-media-and-communications-summit-brokers': \"Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) MoffettNathanson 4th Annual Media & Communications Summit Brokers Conference May 17, 2017  9:00 AM ET\\nExecutives\\nMatt Ellis - Executive Vice President and CFO\\nAnalysts\\nCraig Moffett - MoffettNathanson\\nCraig Moffett\\nGood morning. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth annual summit. And thank you all for the support you've given us as a firm, some of you who saw the last session with Disney heard Michael say the same thing. But, all of us on behalf of the whole firm, we can't thank you enough for the support of -- that you have given us and it's hard to believe that we're now in our fourth year doing this. And thank you for those who are joining us by webcast this morning. I'm really delighted to have Matt Ellis joining us this morning. Matt, congratulations again on your new role.\\nMatt Ellis\\nThank you.\\nCraig Moffett\\nObviously, one of the themes that we're going to talk about a lot throughout this conference and I know the topic just judging by the question I get everybody wants to talk about M&A. I'm going to talk about that with you a little bit, but I want to start with the most recent transaction Straight Path. I wondered if you could just tell us what was it that was so compelling about Straight Path, there was a sort of sense of urgency about getting Straight Path, what was so compelling about it and what do you plan to do with it.\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. So, good morning, Craig and great to be here.\\nBefore I start, I think we have our Safe Harbor slide, which I need to reference if we can -- if we can put that up please. We'll get that up here in the second; obviously we'll make forward-looking statements this morning. I know it's obviously risk associated with that the full statement is on our Web site.\\nSo, with that said, there we go, there it is in all its glory. So, with that said to get to your question, I just think about Straight Path, I'd suggest you think about in terms of the overall ecosystem of building out 5G and really the journey will be on for the last two, three years now.\\nWhen we first started on this, we've talked about -- we felt there was some great used cases around 5G and there was a lot of talk whether the standards aren't going to be there until 2022, 2023. And we said what we think if we put them also behind that, that it doesn't need to be that long. And so we partnered with other carriers around the globe specifically South Korea and Japan. We partnered with some of the network manufacturers such as Samsung and Nokia and Ericsson and you're seeing us really make a lot of progress there.\\nWe've tested the technology first in lab, and then lastly, we took it out allowing to the field. And then, this year obviously we're doing the pre-commercial scale trails that we're just kicking off now. So, what you see us doing is, really building out what we need to launch 5G as we go forward. And obviously, one part of that is spectrum.\\nAnd so we have some 5G, the millimeter way spectrum through the XO transaction that got us 28 gigahertz spectrum in significant parts of the country, but not all of the country. And then, when you look at the Straight Path asset, they bring more of that 28 and also nationwide coverage of 39 gig level. So, it was really a case of adding another asset that's, we're going to need to build out 5G and be able to deploy as quickly as we want to. There will be other 5G spectrum that comes available through FCC auction, but that's probably a couple of years away. And we felt like taking the uncertainty off the table anticipating having to participate in the auction. We now know what we have and it puts us in a position we can deploy the 5G solution as soon as they are available.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd is it fair that I presumably answer to this is as yes, but your engineering tests have been sufficiently positive to say, look this is actually going to work for issues like rain and trees and leaves and that sort of thing that you're confident that there is a real business case for deploying the spectrum.\\n\\nMatt Ellis\\nAbsolutely, so those parts are taking out of the lab last year and doing some of the field trials. We demonstrated that it works. We demonstrated that you can deal with some of those issues and how you do the beam forming as you're operate in these much more high frequency bands, which is different than our traditional spectrum. So, we prove that you can solve those initial challenges of people. So, the point we said right, we're going to now test it on a larger scale, which is what we're in the process of launching right now. We're doing that in the 11 different cities which have different topographies and so we get comfortable with how that you use this spectrum and make it work, and then, we'll deliver the business case is coming out of that.\\nSo, those trials are just starting too soon to tell you how they are going. I'm the most eager person to know. But, we should have answers out of that as we get later into the year and then we'll talk more about specific used cases obviously we think the fixed wireless broadband is will be the first used case, and then, after that we'll get into mobility used cases as well.\\nCraig Moffett\\nI'm going to come back a little bit to fixed wireless broadband later, but I want to start with the core business. In wireless, it's fair to say that first quarter not just for you, but really for the industry as a whole was a very challenging quarter. And with slow growth in phones, but also ARPU is down and I think was the industry's first ever year-over-year service revenue decline after 17 years of growth. Competitive intensity, I would argue is probably the highest we ever saw in the first quarter. What's the argument that it gets better, first for the industry as a whole and then for you specifically?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. So, I would say, look I'll talk about where we are and we feel good about where we are today in the industry, you at the combination of the best network and the largest base of customers. And so, what you saw us do in the first quarter was launching unlimited because we've reached the point where customers were haven't to make a choice. Other carriers are decided to launch unlimited and it was leading how customers to make the choice between to what feature function where I don't have to worry about how much they term using anymore or do want to be on the best network.\\nAnd so what we did as we've launched the unlimited and customers didn't have to make that tradeoff anymore and we immediately saw benefit in the results and as I think we said on the earnings call, I fully expect that we will be fund net of positive during the second quarter. So what we're certainly seeing a turnaround in the business since we launch that.\\nThe other key component around this is when we make that change, it wasn't a price reduction. I know certainly customers optimizing and taking advantage of it. And but, also customers stepping out to it, so overall we think that this will not be a negative to ARPU by going on unlimited. And we're just getting on that same level playing field from a functionality standpoint and going from that. So, we like that we'll position today, we're still premium price and we'll launch in a discipline fashion, is that a premium to where the market is because we have the premium network, so we like where we're performing today.\\nCraig Moffett\\nHave you seen any sign that the competitive intensity that was -- that made the first quarter soft for you and everyone. Have you seen any real signs that's abating in anyway and what you will be looking for you said phone net ad positive, but what else do you look for to say the business is starting to turn?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes, so look from the competitive environment standpoint, it's certainly being a competitive to the industry not just in the past year or so, but it's various times over the last 20 years. And I think if you look where we are today, it shows that we compete effectively even in that type of environment. That was safer how the industry plays out the rest of the year and how it gets more aggressive or less aggressive is different devices come out, we'll wait and see. But from the -- just talk about service revenue first for a second, as an answer to your question.\\n\\nFirst quarter, we saw the negative 6.1% year-over-year and we said we expect second quarter to be in a similar type of range, but then we said we expect the back half of the year to show improvement in that trend. And so break that a part in it and maybe explain why we have that confidence you will see that improve. If you look at the different components in service revenue, one of them is the line access fee. So, if you go back to August of 2015, when we launched the price plan when we introduce small, medium, large, extra large sizes that was when we said we're not going to be fairly even on customer choice between the subsidy model and device payment model where you're going to go more to device payment.\\nAnd when a customer went to a device payment, you go from that $40 line access fee to the $20 that you're correcting the revenue elsewhere in equipment revenue as you know, but from that looking at service revenue you got that trade down. So let get into the third quarter of this year, we have the two year lapping of that really getting behind that and so the headwind in the line access component or service revenue will be less when we get to the back half of the year. And then, the overage component again in the third quarter a year ago we added features to our plan with safety mode and carryover data that's started to allow customers to manage their overage more certainly could in the past and obviously it's a significant feature of unlimited as well that you get there.\\nSo we're seeing significant migration of the base to both the plan we launched last summer with those features and now certainly with unlimited. And so we'll start to allow the anniversary of that as we get into the third quarter as well. And so the headwinds in both the line access and the overage will start to reduce as again for the back half of the year and the other thing that we're seeing is -- we're seeing customers in the base step-up to get to unlimited. It was previously, I'm not sure I want to pay an extra 20 bucks a month to get an extra 4 gig of data, to say while I pay an unlimited and we're seeing more step up that way. So, when you add those things together, the reductions of those headwinds are the way we see line of site to beginning in the third quarter. We're confident that the service revenue, Craig, you get better in the back half of the year.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd do you actually -- we tended to do an accounting adjustment for our ARPU and service revenue, I suspect you internally do the same, so that you can get us sort of apples-to-apples view, I don't know what you'll do at the same way we do, but do you think adjusted for the downdraft that comes from transitioning customers to EIP, do you actually get the positive ARPU growth in the back half of the year?\\nMatt Ellis\\nI think it's -- we certainly see the ARPU situation improve and the exact timing of that get into growth. We'll see whether that comes in the back half of the year whether that gets to sometime further out in the future that depends a little bit and how things play out. But, to your point that's probably also look at service revenue plus installment payments, is what I'm really interest and irrespective of how I fabricated to bill out and all the mess we've made with this. You get to for the total now billing the customer monthly and get in the first quarter even the service revenue was down 6.1% year-over-year, the billings, the service plus installment billings were up on a year-over-year basis, so that's another reason why we feel good about the business.\\nCraig Moffett\\nOkay, good. So then let's talk about your network now because you've talked about going to unlimited and the big controversy I think that I hear from investors is whether the network is ready to handle the kind of load that you're seeing. So, I guess the first place is that I just add 30,000 foot view [ph], how the network holding up as unlimited data usage ramps up and I think the argument was you probably only saw because it came late in the quarter and people had to opt-in, you probably only saw just the front edge of the increase in volumes that you're going to see over the rest of the year.\\n\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes, the networks performing great and it's performing as we expect when we decided to launch unlimited. We started thinking about unlimited last year, well, contentedly we're going to do it, but we obviously was in the marketplace, we asked ourselves something that we can do if we want and obviously the core brand promise that we may consume is about the quality of the network experience.\\nAnd, so we said very early as we started to think about unlimited what we're going to go with that. We're not going to jeopardize that brand promise. So are only going to go there, we're convinced that to the network performance can continue to lead. And so, the network team was confident and that they spend a lot of time on the backend of last year convincing the rest of those, that was the case and so when we decided in the first quarter where we saw the competitiveness in the marketplace and we're seeing customers were really looking for that functionality. We've reached the point where we saw network was that.\\nLook if I breakdown network and I understand where the question comes from. We think about network in terms of coverage capacity. So we completed really the build out coverage of the LTE network really about three years ago now. And since then we've been adding. And there is different ways you add capacity. We think about how the capacity was spectrum. We had capacity with the network architecture and then we had capacity through densification. So from a spectrum standpoint, we continue to deploy more spectrum to our LTE network. Today, we're running just over 50% of our spectrum assets to support LTE network.\\nSo there is significant amount of spectrum we still have to deploy against the current network whether that be the eight of the three spectrum, which is starting to go into service this year whether that be reforming PCs in a 50 megahertz spectrum that's suppose 3G and voice networks if we get customers migrate of those. We've reformed that spectrum over to the LTE network and then I think about hitting into 2018, we're going to get access to unlicensed spectrum too.\\nSo, we are continuing to add spectrum assets for the network, but then you get to the network architecture and whether that be some of the features in LTE advance or whether that be what we're doing with CRAM and those type of technologies. We are more efficiently deploying that the spectrum today, then we were five, six years ago when we launched the LTE network. So every piece of spectrum we have is doing more now and capable of doing more and we see further opportunities to have gains just through the architecture.\\nAnd then you get to densification and we're doing exactly what we said we do, when we came out of the AWS re-auction and there were some cities that we didn't win and we chose not to go. We said there was a price of which and makes more sense to add capacity through densification versus the spectrum. And we've done what we said we're going to do by densifying the network and you're seeing the network performance in that time period since then continues to leave the industry.\\nSo densification very much works. There is still a lot for us to do with densification and a couple of other plus points about densification one, it prepositions the network to 5G because by putting the small sales and putting that dot fiber in you're creating some of that backbone that you're going to need for the next generation network.\\nAnd then secondly, it's more efficient to densify then just to add capacity through spectrum. For example, here in New York it's certainly a market where we had to add capacity. If I'm going to do that through spectrum, I go and buy piece of a spectrum that covers, yes, it covers Manhattan, it covers the five borders, it covers area outside that too. I may not need additional capacity throughout the geography. When I do it through densification, I pinpoint specific location like maybe right here and I'm able to add capacity here without additional capacity where I don't need it, which is obviously that sufficient. So, we're very comfortable with the network performance in unlimited and we're seeing what we thought we'd see when we decided to go in.\\n\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo one of the arguments that I think everybody here will be familiar with is notwithstanding all the things you said about the ways that you add capacity, you're still a broad perception that your spectrum constrained and that particularly relative, if you take metrics like megahertz POP per subscriber and that sort of thing. How do you -- so, to say more about how you think about spectrum, used to be you would say I want to make sure I have spectrum to plan ahead 12 to 18 months. Is that timeframe still appropriate and are you feel confident are you -- you do have the spectrum assets that you need.\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes, we still plan ahead, and that 12 to 18 months window is still the right one that we forecast where we see demand going and we see where we have capacity and then you probably see where that equation looks like it's going to break. And then, you architect the solution and that solution is going to differ by geography, I mean, in the old days you still are just put up another macro sales side and half of the spectrum is make that work.\\nNow it's a question of okay, I'm not going to use small cells and the different type of small cell solutions. So what the right solution for the different where you are going to read purpose small sales solutions. So what's the right solution for the geography what you're going to need to add capacity 12 to 18 months out? And we had -- we showed a video at the sell-side of then last week it's available on the Web site where you can -- we showed three different geographies and how you're densifying in different ways in those different geographies because of the specifics of these location.\\nSo the team continues to do that 12 to 18 months out that's what they've been doing. The thing the engineers are deploying in the field today are things we started planning for in the first half of 2016 and the things that we're planning today is for activity will actually deploy in 2018 and that continues to be the case. Spectrum is one way that we can add that capacity, but it's not the only way and say it's really about looking where we think we see we need additional capacity 12 to 18 months out and then we find the right solution and that is often as much around densification as this is around an eight more spectrum in that particular location.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd so the densification story has been a somewhat slower one for almost everyone than I think we would have anticipated couple of years ago whether it's zoning, whether it's the cost of roof rentals and street furniture rentals and that sort of thing. Can you talk about the pace you said you're planning 12 to 18 months in advance for getting that done, but how long does it take to scale a small sales network in a given location?\\nMatt Ellis\\nBut -- you start some of the points that are there, I mean, certainly it is owning and premising and someone takes time, which is why we plan that for in advance. So that we can get it done. And that's we are -- I think we know how to do that we've been doing it for a longtime. We're showing that we can get there. I don't think you don't just go in and say I'm going to densify the city. Okay, it's done densifying. There is layers to them. You're going to initial densification, you comeback in densify further on so.\\nAnd so it's continuous how we do that in different geographies because you're adding the capacity that you're going to need some for us in the future 18 to 24 months out. But, I'm not mostly trying to put the capacity and I'm going to need 10 years now that will be a little inefficient to deploy that fast. So, but the reason why we do it that its just the timing to get the permits to work with the local authorities to get that. I think we know how to do that now. And I think we've demonstrated that's why we've added the amount of densification we have in numerous cities across the country and you see it in the network results.\\n\\nCraig Moffett\\nIt's fair to say that's becoming a more and more important part of your capital budget.\\nMatt Ellis\\nThe densification piece?\\nCraig Moffett\\nYes.\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. I think when you look at the capital budget overall, the number stays fairly consistent, but what is -- what's in that evolve significantly overtime, you think you go back number of years obviously there is around 3G and then it shifted to Fios, and then, it shifted to 4G. And even within 4G, it's moved from initially was about coverage to now it's moved to capacity and within capacity there is the fair amount of that -- the densification. As I said earlier, we're thinking about not just deploying densification for 4G, but how as you put that densification in, we're pre-positioning for 5G deployments as well so we make that asset deployment is efficient as possible.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd so bottom-line I guess for me and for a lot of your investors is -- is that the core for Verizon strategy of network advantage and wireless still possible, is there a still room for network advantage to be a differentiator and do you still own that position?\\nMatt Ellis\\nAbsolutely. And I think that shows up in the numbers we saw in the second half of the first quarter. After we took away the functionality difference unlimited versus not unlimited. And you saw the numbers we had in the second half and that's with the price premium again where some of the other guys are. So it shows the consumers understand the value of the network that willing to pay that premium to get on the Verizon network experience and we fully expect to continue that. And we're -- as I think about not just in 4G LTE, but it gets to 5G, we're confident that we're leading the way that we're going to deploy that first and continue that history of that network leadership.\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo let's talk about 5G for a second, you mentioned the trials that you're already doing and that's it's maybe too early to report anything back on what you're seeing, but what's your intuition about let's take fixed wireless broadband for a second, what's your intuition about the geographies where it's going to make sense? And does it make sense only in extremely dense markets; is it make sense only in sort of -- the suburban rings around dense markets? Where is the business case play out for fixed wireless?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. So I think what ultimately depends on is how far you can kind of propagate that signal, right? And that's really why we're doing the trails to get comfortable with how far really says how far out in that dense urban to suburban ring and so on. It makes sense to go. So, we'll have more sense later in the year on that on the size of that particular opportunity. We certainly think it's significant. We certainly think it's a meaning business case and we look forward to get into the end of the trials and being able to be a little more specific about that, but we don't believe at this point is just a dense urban opportunity, we think it moves little more broader than that.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd like in the case of building a wire line network, is it I'm guessing advantage to in places where there is aerial infrastructure relative to varied infrastructure and it presumably it's easier in places where there is telephone polls or street furniture than in places where there is not street furniture, which I guess has become a euphemism for streetlight.\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. So as you think about it and really what I may take you back from this one is what we're doing in Boston, which is about the value of the fiber network across multiple usage and architecting that network to provide multiple uses whether it's connecting sales sites whether that's a 5G sales site or becoming a 5G sales site whether it's providing a residential solution those as we are in the Boston field with the Fios product rather it's connecting small businesses or enterprise businesses going into the two buildings in the center of the city and connecting those out for enterprise solutions. And then even as we move forward here how do you connect top, these Smart City solutions, the kiosks that are out there that you see a number of cities now to full pass on the way here this morning, right and then the smart lighting solutions and traffic cameras in the like. And so in the case in that fiber in, that's going to support those multiple usage including the 5G business case and when you build, if you think about the fiber going out using the street architecture and as you say aerial plans easier, then obviously when you have to go dig the ground, but it's the combination of those things and I think we've also learned how you go even when you have to put the fiber below ground, we know how to go do that as sufficient as possible.\\n\\nCraig Moffett\\nLowell has talked about the architecture that you're using in Boston and Nick and I some of you may have seen just published a pretty sense of report on the 5G architecture there are small sales part two piece that suggest it's a pretty expensive proposition to start doing 1,700 strand sheet in lots of different geographies. Is it a fair expectation you said before that the mix within your capital budget changes overtime, but is it reasonable to assume that as you start to build extensive 5G that's -- it's going to have to take just paying more capital spending that is in the more capital intensive business thing what we've seen so far?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes, I don't know that's -- I wouldn't necessarily say that's the case, I mean, we're going to have to say we'll get through the trials and we'll determine the size of the opportunity as we discuss, and then, we will decide how quickly we decide to deploy against. So let's say more to come but I'm not sure that I had to say that's not a foregone conclusion by any means.\\nCraig Moffett\\nI'm going to wrap-up on wireless with just one last question and that is your margins in wireless have consistently been the envy of everyone in the industry, but that's what the blessing and the curse, right, I mean, there is some who would argue that we've seen peak margins that will never be sustainably that good. There are others that would say now you've actually got as upgrade rates stay low and you keep taking cost out of the business. How do you think about those two things and how do you think about the margin trajectory of the wireless business as you look out?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes, I like that question, we've -- I think we've got it for a number of years now and we keep getting asked it because we keep producing the margins, right. So, look it's about continuing to improve the efficiency of the business. And we don't always talk about probably as much as we should do. But, there is a number of ways you see as continuous to improve the cost side of the wireless business. It starts with network and as we deploy the network more efficiently this year than we did last year and the year before that the cost of it comes down. And we're constantly doing that and that's being something that each generation of the wireless industry you've seen us do that the first year of any of the generations is the most expensive cost per bit and it continues to come down from that and we could see a continued line of site with the LTE network to continue to bring down that cost a bit through the remainder of this year, next year and going forward.\\nSo the network piece, we think continuous to get more efficient and then as you think about other parts of the cost structure from a distribution standpoint, we think there is still opportunity to reduce the cost of the distribution side by making distribution more of a digital first activity. And so there is opportunities there to continue to reduce the cost and then on the customer care side, we continue to work and understand what's causing customers have to call and takeaway those reasons as causing them to call. And if there are things they need to do, how can you do that in a self so fashion with the app we launched last year, there is a number of things that customer use we have to make a call and they can now do on their own time and just take care of themselves, so…\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd is it fair to say that the customer who is on an unlimited plan has a lot fewer reasons to call?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. I mean there is obviously less things they have to call about so that helps the cost side of the equation. So there is a number of levers there to continue to drive the costs side, whether it's network, distribution care, other things, too. So, that's an every year activity for us. It's not just kind of a one-off program.\\n\\nCraig Moffett\\nIt used to be in these interviews we would say now let's turn to the wireline business, but in some ways, the wireline business isn't really a separate business anymore. A lot of what you've been talking about is really the integration of wireless and wireline. So, let me step back for a second because you've divested a lot of your wireline assets to frontier in a couple of sequential transactions. But on the other hand, you seem to be increasing your dependence on wires. Can you talk about that -- that tradeoff of on one-hand covering wires whether from someone else or building more and on the other hand divesting some of what you already have?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. We still very much do have two segments, how we think about go to market, we go to market with wireless products and services and go to market with wireline products and services, that's not fundamentally changing. What you're seeing change a little bit more is the network provisions that historically we've talked about the wireline network and the wireless network and as you said that's where you're seeing more convergence because the wireless network that the reach of fiber into the wireless network or wires in general is a lot more than used to be as you move from a macro sales site network to one with more small cells in.\\nSo, what's important to how the products and services we offer whether that's a wireline or wireless to wireline or wireless customer is the quality of that fiber asset in the underlying network architecture and so you've seen the things we've done around that certainly talked a little bit about Boston and how we're building the network there and you should think about as a blueprint for how we're building fiber in other locations as well.\\nYou mentioned we've divested some assets obviously the last one was the trade geographies that we've divested the frontier last year. What we really did as we took those properties and still had a large amount of copper in them. We've divested those and we took the proceeds and use that to buy the XO asset, which gave us fiber metro rings in 45 of the top markets around the country. So, we are certainly committed to the wireline asset. It's the foundation of the networks both the provision wireline and wireless. And in addition to obviously buying assets like XO, you see the agreements recently with Corning and Prysmian to spend $1.3 billion over the next three years buying fiber. So, we're committed to the wireline business because it's really -- it's the backbone of all of the network services that we're offering.\\nCraig Moffett\\nOne of the alarming numbers to me that I saw in anybody's first quarter report was the decline -- the rate of decline in AT&T's wireline business, in their commercial wireline business -- it was much more of a constant trajectory that it's been a -- it's not an easy business, but they had a very deep acceleration in the rate of decline in commercial wireline. Are you seeing -- what are you seeing or is that a [Canadian] [ph] coal mine for that industry, and that segment as a whole is getting more challenging?\\nMatt Ellis\\nI think we're seeing the continuation of the trends you're seeing in the results of the past few years now. So, we've done a couple of things in that space, we've -- first of all at the start of this year we've talked about reporting of those customer segments. We used to have consumer mass business and then enterprise and within that you had within consumer mass business, it was obviously, consumer was the primary focus. And then within enterprise certainly the larger customers of the focus and so we brought at the mass business out of the consumer piece, we brought the more medium size business out of the enterprise and perform that new customer group. And they are very much focused on the SMB space including state and local government in education institutions. And so now that we got a group and so we focus on that category for developing product offerings where you may bundle the voice and data needs of those types of customers in a product that fits for them. And we're optimistic that will help us to offset some of the secular declines in just from legacy, voice and data from copper based services.\\n\\nWhen you get to the enterprise base, you actually got some of those secular declines that we're seeing out for few years. But, I think we have been the first to deploy some of the SD-WAN products in that space and seeing great take rates from customers. And so we got those product offerings out there, so network virtualization offerings out there that are really allowing us to grow those businesses that offset some of the secular decline.\\nSo, we are confident that the revenue trajectory we are being -- we are still being that low single-digit negative number where we see the things we are doing in terms of new products and services providing off an offset to the decline on the legacy that we don't see any significant like downward trend that you discussed.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd what about in the consumer business, what's the future of Fios for you?\\nMatt Ellis\\nFios is a great business. I mean it's -- I think you see in this quarter we've added some things with around the gigabit connection.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd had that had real traction?\\nMatt Ellis\\nWe are seeing some tractions. Certainly, what you've got is and it continues to be -- because of the symmetrical upload and download speeds. We believe it is a superior product, other products that are out there and when we put the right offering out there around it, we see it resonate in the marketplace.\\nSo, it continues to be in -- broadband is going to be very important to the home connection going forward. More so today than it was yesterday and more so tomorrow than yesterday. Customers have continued to connect more devices in their home to their broadband network. And so, having that broadband network that can handle all those connections on it is incredibly important and we think the Fios network gives consumers the best broadband network that -- to handle with that.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd so that, I take it -- that is still a business that you see as strategically core?\\nMatt Ellis\\nI think offering broadband in-home solutions is still…\\nCraig Moffett\\nNortheast as I always…\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. At this point certainly in the northeast is where we got that footprint and but we think that continues to be very important product.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd I guess the same question I ask about on the wireless side, wirelines margins have actually been one of the untold stories, you actually had a nice turn in wireline margins. How much more runways there for wireline margins or lapping the Frontier transaction that we now seen most of what we are going to get?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. We said we would take out the stranded cost with the Frontier transaction the teams worked well there. And you are also getting to the point this year, where you are going to lap some of the benefits coming out of the labor contract last year. But, we said and certainly first quarter came in a little north of 22%. Let's say fluctuations in the margin throughout the year as we typically doing wireline. But, for the year as a whole, we certainly think we're better than the year ago, below 20% range.\\nAnd we are continuing taking cost out of -- as we go forward. I think that the wireline team because of some of those secular declines that we talked about have been out there for a while. The team really knows how to continue to attack the cost side of the equation and you see that -- and that's why you see the results and the margins you do. So, we think, as I say, it will be in the low 20s and we will -- let's see what we can do next year on top of that.\\nCraig Moffett\\nI guess the one last thing we haven't talked about yet within the portfolio is AOL and Yahoo. Is that big enough to move the needle as a growth driver?\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes, absolutely. I mean so just that we close when you take the two businesses even without any integration benefit, the $7 billion business on an annualized run rate. So, that's not small by any means. And you had Tim talk about last week; his goal is to get by 2020 up to around $10 billion or so. So, that business has the ability to move the needle. We think there is tremendous advantage of bringing the Yahoo, the eyeballs they have, the content platforms they have into -- merger that with the AOL content and then you got the ad tech platform underneath and that's -- the challenge today with the current business is just not having as many eyeballs there as we need to drive the growth there, when you bring the volume of eyeballs that Yahoo has and you start building out these super challenge that we talked about around news and sports and finance and tech and lifestyle and so on. There is a tremendous opportunity to build a very good platform. Tim likes to talk about building the brands that consumers love and building platforms that companies love and that's the challenge the team is working on. They got a great integration plan. They are ready to go and we look forward to closing and getting on with it.\\n\\nCraig Moffett\\nWe were joking about Game of Thrones before and there is certainly a sense pervading this summit of that there is this sort of dependency of a huge wave of M&A coming. Your strategy has been pretty different than -- certainly than AT&T. But, then a lot of peers and then a lot of what people expected and that you have done a series of what by contrast or relatively small deals, now we are straight past but previously with Yahoo and then going back to AOL. Nothing like the kind of giant deals that some people have speculated about.\\nBefore we talk about what -- that piece of it, when I look across the portfolio can you get this business back to consolidated GDP like growth without big acquisitions?\\nMatt Ellis\\nAbsolutely. And look you start with service revenue and what is, obviously that is the biggest part of the business today and just moving that piece. So, we talked about some of the headwinds are in the service revenue piece right now that we line of sites as we get to the second half of the year start to anticipate. So, excited about that. Certainly with the change in the customer acquisition metrics pre-imposed on limited makes us feel good about the impact on service revenue and wireless.\\nSo, as we say we expect service revenue trends to improve in the second half of the year and get back to year-over-year number during the course of 2018. So that will be a significant move from what you've seen over the past year or so.\\nWireline we talked about we think a lot of the trends there are -- you are going to see what we have been seeing. And then, the growth from the new businesses, we certainly think the combination of AOL Yahoo an obvious $7 billion business, it will grow significantly from there. And even Telematics with the acquisitions we did last year, does now a business, it's about $1 billion annual run rate from a revenue standpoint with significant growth ahead of it. So, you add all of those things up and we certainly see that there is path to revenue growth as you go forward here, as you just kind of work through those headwinds over the course of the next few months and quarters and you get back to just the businesses we own and closing the Yahoo and being where we need to be.\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo, now let's talk about the topic everybody wants to talk about. We've made jokes about whether it's the dating game or tender or all those kinds of all the different combinations that everybody wants to make for everybody else. And everybody would claim billionaire match maker here. You've been matched to wireline asset, the cable operators and to be fair, you -- the company didn't go out of your way to dispel the idea that you might be interested in buying cable. You've also been speculated as a buyer of big spectrum assets. You have been speculated as a buyer of content companies. And talk about each of those things if you will, and just kind of how you think about this -- strategic sufficiency of the portfolio and what each of those things might bring?\\nMatt Ellis\\nSo, let me maybe take it to a high level first and think about -- talk about how we think about M&A in general. You start with -- you have the strategy of what it is, you are trying to do with the business, how you are going to grow the business going forward. And then, the question comes does M&A provide an opportunity to accelerate the execution of that strategy and do it in a manner that generates additional shareholder value that is just organically building and executing that strategy.\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo that seems like -- that's distinct from say, we are not diverse, we are not talking about M&A as diversification, we are talking about it in service of our existing assets, is that fair to say that's the guiding…\\nMatt Ellis\\n\\nWe always have to articulate how M&A fits with the existing strategy of the business, okay? And so, when you apply those two screens, does it accelerate the execution of the strategy and can you do it in a fashion that create shareholder value, a large number of opportunities don't survive going through those two screens.\\nAnd you've seen the things we have done and it's been different to what some other folks have done. Look, India we think about kind of network assets and fiber assets, we talked a bunch over the past few months about why we think fiber is important, the fact there is a lot of fiber that's out there. But, it's not really the fiber that we are looking for to execute our strategy and how we want to build the network and it just kind of converged fiber network that we have spoken about.\\nSo, look at this and asset out there that allows us to accelerate the deployment of that in a way that creates shareholder value, we certainly we look at that. But, as you heard Lowell said in the TV interview did a couple of weeks ago, we haven't seen anyone who has got the network architecture that we are looking for. And certainly by the agreements that we talked about with Corning and so we've shown that we're certainly comfortable just organically adding to that network capacity to get where we want to go. And I think that same type of thinking applies across other spaces too.\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo the spectrum and content same concepts?\\nMatt Ellis\\nThe spectrum -- as it relates to LTE as I think about spectrum, you say okay I know I need to continue to add capacity to LTE network, we talked a lot about earlier. And I can't do that by adding spectrum. So, said all along that spectrum at the right price is certainly something that we would have a conversation about. We buy spectrum in the secondary market all the time. We did a number of transactions last year and continue to do so. So spectrum at the right price is certainly something we do.\\nBut, we have other opportunities to densify the network and get what we need to. When you move to 5G, we said we don't have the spectrum that we need, we are not sure that we want to wait for an option. And the certainly around timing of that and you don't know how an auction is going to play out. We said let's go ahead and go get that spectrum and certainly we have done that through both XO and now Straight Path, so that we can execute how 5G strategy on the timeline we want to and not have to wait for the asset to be available.\\nAnd then, as you think about content look. The content industry is changing; we've all talked a lot about some of the pressure in linear TV. But, just because of that pressure that doesn't mean consumers are consuming less content. They are just doing in a very different way, and certainly the -- as we bring AOL and Yahoo together under the Oath brand. We think that will be a significant platform of which consumers come and consume content. Some of that content we own. We own some today with AOL as things like Huffpost and Tech Crunch and so on. And certainly, Yahoo has a good amount of its own content, but we are also confident with the ad tech platform we can participate in the monetization of that through digital rights and not having to own all the content that comes through there as well.\\nSo, look we're constantly looking at, how the content evolving as the way people consuming is evolving and we will see the best way for us to participate. We are happy getting digital rights as we do today. And using that as the way that we can then monetize through the ad tech platform.\\nCraig Moffett\\nSo, I want to wrap-up with a question about the balance sheet. There is just the 8-K that came out about a week or so about the S&P change in targets. Is there anything you can add about the trajectory of your leverage ratios and your targets?\\n\\nMatt Ellis\\nYes. Really that was -- all that was really about was the trajectory hasn't changed as we said in the release. We are committed to a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics. And so, I don't see a change in the trajectory, the reason why we issued that 8-K was of course, S&P too changed their view of the industry and therefore their requirement to get to the higher credit metric move and that was one we saw. We are not sure our trajectory was online with that new numbers. So, we felt that it was the right thing to do to communicate to our investors.\\nBut, the way we are managing the balance sheet hasn't changed as the result of them kind of changing that metric. So, I continue to expect, I will see the same improvement in the credit metrics that I would have done if they have left that threshold in the place they previously had them.\\nCraig Moffett\\nAnd we are just about out of time, so, I want to leave it for you to -- as you look out at the audience, you've got an awful a lot of either shareholders or potential shareholders here. What do you think that they might not understand or should understand better about Verizon. And make the case for why at this valuation they have to own Verizon?\\nMatt Ellis\\nLook, I see tremendous opportunities across our businesses we go forward and that's of many levels. Look, and it stops with the portfolio of network assets we have that allows to be the network leader today but also as we get into next generations of technology.\\nSo, we have the best LTE network, we have great fiber assets and we are leading the way as we go to 5G undeniably so. So, when I think about that network is the foundation of the strategy and allow us to do things at a faster pace, then I think a lot of the other folks that we compete with. And so then, we have those network functions both now and as we think looking forward and you combine that with the base of customers we have. The products and services that we have the opportunity to develop and enrich people's life in this connected world that we live in, we have the opportunity to do things at a scale that I don't think anyone else has.\\nAnd so that's a tremendous opportunity and you add-in what we are doing with some of the new businesses and so, we got into those businesses, we were comfortable with them and then we decided, okay, now, it's the time to add scale, so we certainly done that and we will talk about what we are doing with Oath and we are doing in Telematics and those businesses come in together. So there is a number of opportunities for us lead going forward and to generate significant shareholder value.\\nAnd I look forward to being back here and we can talk about the progress that we've made and I'm very confident that we are going to deliver on across that portfolio.\\nCraig Moffett\\nMatt, I look forward to that as well. And I thank you for coming this year and I thank all of you for joining us.\\nMatt Ellis\\nThank you.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nEnd of Q&A\", '/article/4165238-verizon-communications-vz-q1-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript': \"Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 24, 2018  8:30 AM ET\\nExecutives\\nBrady Connor - SVP, Investor Relations\\nMatthew Ellis - EVP & CFO\\nAnalysts\\nSimon Flannery - Morgan Stanley\\nPhilip Cusick - JPMorgan\\nBrett Feldman - Goldman Sachs\\nJohn Hodulik - UBS\\nMichael Rollins - Citi\\nDavid Barden - Bank of America\\nCraig Moffett - MoffettNathanson\\nJennifer Fritzsch - Wells Fargo\\nAmir Rozwadowski - Barclays\\nScott Goldman - Jefferies\\nMike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities\\nOperator\\nGood morning, and welcome to the Verizon First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]\\nToday's conference is being recorded. If you have any questions, you may disconnect at this time\\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\\nBrady Connor\\nThanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I'm here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\\nAs a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.\\nBefore I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are now available on our website.\\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.\\nAs of January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting standards that will impact the way we record certain transactions going forward, and some that will require recast of historical information. These new standards include ASC 606 for revenue recognition, changes related to the presentation of pension items on the income statement and updates for the cash flow reporting of restricted cash and collection of receivables with off-balance securitizations. We plan to recast the 2017 Form 10-K following the filing of our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q to address the adoption of the pension and cash flow reporting standards that require retrospective treatment.\\nBefore Matt goes to the results, I'd like to walk through a few items. For the first quarter 2018 we reported earnings of $1.11 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items I would like to highlight.\\nOur reported first-quarter earnings include an early debt redemption charge of about $249 million and roughly $107 million of acquisition and integration costs primarily related to Oath. The net impact of these items after-tax was approximately $266 million, or $0.06 per share.\\nExcluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.17 in the first quarter compared to $0.95 a year ago. Included in the differences approximately $0.21 due to the net effects of tax reform and the adoption of the revenue recognition standard. On a comparable basis, adjusted earnings per share before the impacts of tax reform and revenue recognition was up 1.1% year-over- year.\\n\\nNext, I'd like to discuss the revenue recognition standard impact on our results. In order to provide additional clarity regarding the impact of the revenue recognition standard on our quarterly results, we have included the table on slide four that illustrates the effect across the business.\\nThe impact of the revenue recognition standard resulted in a reduction of wireless service revenue, offset by an increase in wireless equipment revenue, as well as the deferral of commission expense in both our wireless and wireline segments.\\nFor the remainder of this call, we will discuss results excluding the impact of the accounting change to provide clear comparability with prior periods unless otherwise noted.\\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, Brady. Good morning, everyone and, thank you for joining us today. Let me start with a recap with our priorities of 2018 which we laid out earlier this year. We are laser focused on executing on the fundamentals, positioning the business of future growth and delivering sustainable financial performance for long-term value creation.\\nWe are enhancing our network leadership position, strengthening our customer relationships and driving efficiencies throughout the business. The cornerstone in our strategy is to provide customers with the best network and user experience. As reflected by our strong customer loyalty.\\nWe have again been recognized by RootMetrics as the best overall network outright for reliability, speed, data and co-performance for the ninth straight reporting period.\\nAs streaming video has become the primary driver of data usage, Verizon stands alone in providing the leading performance of video delivery. Recently, our wireless network was recognized by another third-party as having the best video success rate and the largest percentage of video streaming in high definition across the industry.\\nThrough our investments in spectrum, including millimeter wave, deployments within fiber network architecture and expansion of software defined networking capabilities, Verizon remains the clear leader in 4G and has the assets to provide the broadest, fastest and most advanced next generation network in the world.\\nThe demand for our fiber-based products continues to accelerate. And our Intelligent Edge Network design gives us the ability to meet customer needs of broadband to mobility services, an environment where quality of connection matters more now than ever before.\\nIn addition, the evolution of our Intelligent Edge Network architecture provides the flexibility and efficiencies to offer increased capacity and throughput, low latency, unmatched reliability and enhanced speeds.\\nWe have started the year with strong momentum and have delivered solid financial performance, including consolidated revenue growth, led by continued progress in the wireless business.\\nIt has now been a full year since we launched our original unlimited plans, and the offerings have evolved to provide value and choice for customers. We will continue to mold our compelling value proposition and provide the quality of network and user experience that customers demand.\\nIn an unlimited wireless world, we are driving revenue accretion thorough increase in the number of customer relationships and deepening the participation within our existing base by adding more devices and services. In addition, we are pre-positioned in the network to further enhance wireless growth opportunities with next generation technologies.\\nOur 5G deployment is progressing as planned. We are quickly approaching the initial launch of our residential broadband service later this year, which will be the first use case of a broader 5G strategy. We are driving the ecosystem for future growth across the entire array of 5G services.\\n\\nWith regard to our Oath business, we are deepening the engagement with our user base, creating opportunities for further monetization in the future. Consolidated EBITDA increased as we leveraged our scale into operational efficiencies thorough business excellence initiatives. Our disciplined capital allocation model allowed us to strengthen the business, while investing in our networks of future growth and long-term value creation.\\nLet's dig deeper into the first quarter operating performance with a consolidated level, followed by Wireless and Wireline results and our Media and Telematics businesses.\\nNow onto slide six. Consolidated revenue was $29.9 billion, excluding the impact of Oath and divested businesses, an increase of approximately 3.2%. The primary driver was solid performance in the Wireless business with improved service revenue results, as customers enjoyed unlimited access on the nation's best wireless network.\\nWe are on track to deliver low single digit percentage consolidated revenue growth on a reported basis for the full year 2018. On a consolidated basis excluding special items, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.8%, which was down 70 basis points due to higher wireless equipment revenue and the inclusion of Yahoo in this year's results.\\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $0.5 billion due to steady improvement in operational efficiencies and increased penetration across our high quality customer base. With that, we are on track to realize low single digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS in 2018 before the impact of tax reform and revenue recognition.\\nLet's turn now to slide seven, to review cash flow results and the balance sheet. In the first quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $6.6 billion, up $5.3 billion from last year. This was primarily driven by stronger operational results, lower discretionary pension contributions and as we have previously communicated, the reduction of working capital headwinds from the completion of the device payment plan portfolio transition from off-balance-sheet to on balance sheet financing.\\nAs part of our commitment to strengthen the balance sheet and providing financial flexibility to grow the business, we made a discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to improve the funded status of our pension plans. As a result, we do not project to have any mandatory pension contributions until approximately 2026.\\nTotal capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion over the prior year. We maintain our 2018 guidance range for capital expenditures of $17.0 billion to $17.8 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be more evenly distributed throughout 2018 than in previous years.\\nFree cash flow for the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up $3.8 billion. We ended the quarter with $119.1 billion of total debt, comprised of $109.0 billion of unsecured debt and $10.1 billion of on balance sheet securitizations.\\nTotal debt was up $2.5 billion year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in our asset-backed borrowings of $3.8 billion. The total debt balance is expected to decline as we begin to realize that cash benefits of tax reform later this year.\\nNow, let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with Wireless on slide eight. Total Wireless operating revenue increased 4.7% to $21.9 billion in the first quarter.\\nService revenue performance produced solid results in the quarter driven by customer step ups to higher access plans. The quality of our overall customer experience and value proposition, as well as our measured approach to promotional activity in a highly competitive environment.\\nOn May 8th of last year, we used a chart on the lower half of the slide to communicate the impact of unlimited on service revenue trajectory and our expectations for future trends to improve. We are pleased to report that service revenues for the quarter was flat versus the prior year. We saw year-over-year improvement throughout the quarter with service revenue turning positive in the month of March.\\n\\nWe now have 81% of our post-paid phone base on unsubsidized plans compared to 72% for the same period last year. On a reported basis, including the revenue recognition standard, service revenue was down 2.4%. We expect the momentum in the service revenue trajectory to continue and we are on track for growth to turn positive on a reported basis around the end of the year.\\nEquipment revenue increased 22.1% driven by the mix of higher priced handsets and increased activations. Approximately 49% of post-paid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance at the end of the quarter, similar to last year.\\nOur Wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.3%. This represents an improvement of 120 basis points driven by the strength of our service revenue results and ongoing focus on operational excellence throughout the business.\\nLet's now turn to slide nine and take a closer look at Wireless operating metrics. First quarter is seasonally the lowest volume period of the year coming off with a holiday retail season. Overall, we gained 260,000 post-paid net ads, consisting of phone losses of 24,000 and tablet losses of 75,000, offset by 359,000 other connected devices primarily wearables.\\nSmartphone net additions to the quarter were 220,000, as customers looked to connect their sophisticated devices to the best wireless network in the U.S. Our unlimited offerings continue to provide a compelling value and overall customer experience that has led to post-paid phone churn of 0.80% for the quarter. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of customer attention at 0.80% or better.\\nTotal retail post-paid churn of 1.04% decreased year-over-year. Total post-paid device activations were 2.3% higher than the prior year of which about 80% were phones. In a seasonally low, we had 5.0% of our retail post-paid base upgrade to a new device, down from 5.2%.\\nDuring the quarter, 77% of phone activations were on device payment plans. Prepaid activity in the quarter reflected a total net loss of 335,000 devices, of which 261 where basic phone losses.\\nLet's move next to our Wireline segment on slide 10. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment decreased 1.8% for the quarter, as growth from our high quality fiber-based products was more than offset by secular pressures from legacy technology shifts, trends from cord cutting and pricing pressures in a highly competitive environment.\\nConsumer markets revenue decreased 1.7% primarily driven by legacy core revenue declines. Fios consumer revenue increased 1.2% driven by the growing demand for high quality broadband service. The mix shift away from triple-play bundles pressured revenue trends, but the margin impact was largely offset by the corresponding reduction in content expenditures.\\nWe added 66,000 Fios Internet customers on the strength of our high speed fiber offerings, as customers seek the best broadband experience. Fios Video losses of 22,000 were indicative of a continued secular trend for cord cutting on the traditional linear video bundle.\\nExcluding the XO acquisition, enterprise solutions revenue decreased 4.2% in the quarter, driven primarily by declines in legacy products and pricing pressure in the market that more than offset growth in demand for fiber based services. On a constant currency basis, the year-over-year decline was 5.7%.\\nPartner solutions revenue decreased 0.4% with our XO. We see fiber demand as the main driver for future growth opportunities within this segment. In business markets revenue declined 5.7% [ph] without XO. We have good trajectory with our fiber based services, but these are offset by declines in legacy products.\\nWireline segment EBITDA margin was 20.4%. We continue to benefit from operational efficiency gains, but steady increases in content cost and secular pressures within legacy technologies remain headwinds.\\n\\nLet's now move on to slide 11 to discuss our Media and IoT businesses. The integration of the Oath assets is progressing well. Accelerating our mobile first strategy and positioning us at global reach and future growth in premium content distribution and programmatic advertising capabilities across our key verticals.\\nAs expected, Oath gross revenue decreased sequentially about 13% from the fourth quarter to $1.9 billion due to seasonally lower display advertising volumes. Our organizational integration was largely completed in 2017, and the focus in 2018 has now shifted to streamlining platforms and products, unlocking cost and revenue synergies on the way.\\nDuring the quarter, we achieved a full integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo video supply-side platforms into a unified platform and go-to-market strategy. This positions the business of future growth, as we establish our role as a value added partner for advertising customers.\\nIn the Telematics business, as part of the ongoing integration of the Fleetmatics and Telogis acquisitions, we have created the new Verizon Connect organization. Total Verizon Connect revenue was $234 million in the first quarter. Total IoT revenue, including Verizon Connect was up approximately 13%.\\nLet's now move to slide 12 to review our strategy for future growth. We are confident in our strategy of laying the foundation for future growth, while maintaining a strong leadership position in 4G LTE coverage, reliability and capacity.\\nThe execution model remains unchanged in terms of delivering strong financial results, allocating capitol to position the business for future growth, while strengthening our balance sheet and returning long-term value to our shareholders.\\nOur Wireless value proposition is allowing more and more customers to experience unlimited service on the best network in the United States. We exited the quarter with strong momentum and produced operational and financial performance in a highly competitive environment, while investing in all our businesses and driving cost efficiencies.\\nLast year we announced our goal to drive $10 billion in cumulative cash savings throughout the business over the next four years. Our business excellence initiative, which includes implementing zero-based budgeting has already yielded positive results in the first quarter, realizing approximately $200 million of savings thorough process improvements, work streamlining and automation. The program is on track to deliver against our goals over the four year period.\\nIn addition to the operational improvements in the business, the benefits from corporate tax reform will be realized throughout the remainder of the year, which will provide additional flexibility and enable us to execute on our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet.\\nWe are pre-positioning our networks as fiber infrastructure, spectrum resources, and the rollout with our Verizon Intelligent Edge Network architecture. We are excited about the initial commercial launch in our 5G residential broadband offering later this year, as the first slice of a multi-use asset.\\nWe are on the forefront of innovation that will drive the full suite of services and used cases that will be delivered by 5G technologies. We have successfully completed our 11 city 5G pre-commercial trials where we demonstrated propagation over 2000 feet from the node on millimeter wave spectrum.\\nWe have moved into the commercial deployment phase for the residential broadband launch in the second half of this year. Deployment of commercial nodes on our own fiber asset is underway in the initial markets. And earlier this month, we performed successful end-to-end 5G data sessions in these locations using commercial equipment that will be deployed from the launch later this year.\\n\\nThe ecosystem for 5G is progressing with advancements being realized around global standards and technology developments. Progress is being made at the state and city level to drive sustainable economics around sell-side deployment, creating the pathway to better serving in their communities.\\nMillimeter wave spectrum enables a whole new array of services that will be delivered through ultra-wideband 5G technologies. We are well-positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities that 5G has to offer.\\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Brady, so we can get to your questions.\\nBrady Connor\\nThank you, Matt. Brad, we are now ready to take questions.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer section. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead\\nSimon Flannery\\nThanks a lot. Good morning, Matt. I wanted to follow up on the 5G broadband rollout. When do you think you'll give us more visibility about the three to five markets, the timeline around when you're rolling that out, how many homes?\\nAnd then related questions, I think you said pre-standards. When do you think the standards-based CPE will be available so you can really scale this? And then finally, what's your video strategy here? Are you going to have an OTT offering to the bundle with the broadband product? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nGood morning, Simon. Thank you for the question.\\nSimon Flannery\\nMorning…\\nMatthew Ellis\\nSo in terms of the timeline for the three to five markets, as we said earlier this year, and when we made the announcement in November 29, those - all of those markets will launch in the second half of this year.\\nSo we announced at Sacramento will be one of those cities and the other cities will announce as we get closer to launch date. But we are very much on track with being in a position to launch each of those cities later this year.\\nAs I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are in the process of deploying assets in each of those markets and look forward to bringing that service to consumers in those markets in 2018.\\nAs you mentioned, the launch this year will be on our proprietary standard, and this gives us the opportunity to get a product out in the market before others and to demonstrate that millimeter wave does exactly the things that we said it does. But obviously over time, we want to move to the standards-based CPE, and we expect to be getting that CPE based off of the NR standard, probably in 2019.\\nLook, what I would I say is the network is being pre-positioned to be able to launch 5G as soon as customer equipment is ready, whether that be in-home CPE for residential broadband or weather that be handsets with 5G mobility. We'll be ready as soon as equipment is ready on the global standard.\\nAnd in your final question was around a video strategy for the residential broadband launch. So that's - we've got that underway. We continue to look OTT options, and as we've said previously, we're not looking to launch a need to product, but certainly expect to have an overall product offering to consumers in those three to five markets that will be compelling to meet their needs\\nSimon Flannery\\nGreat. Thank you.\\nBrady Connor\\nBrad, I think we're ready for the next question.\\nOperator\\nThe next comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nI wonder if I can follow up first on my question from January about your target leverage. Has the Company come up with a way to think about leverage under the new tax regime, especially with no cash pension obligations for the next eight years?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So Phil, we continue to look at the - our goal to improve leverage. And really to get back to that pre-Vodafone credit raiding and we've had plenty of conversations at the rating agencies around that and how our leverage looks in a post- tax reform world.\\n\\nBut look, we're in a great position as we demonstrated this quarter. We grew the EBITDA side of the business. And then as we talked about as the benefits of tax reform from a cash basis later this year, we'll see improvements in the debt side of it.\\nSo we're on track to improve the leverage and look forward to - not too distant future as we're having that conversation with the agencies about the timing of being in a position to get us back to where we want.\\nBut I think if you look historically where our leverage ratios were on an adjusted basis, when you adjust for the sellco ownership, you have a fair idea of where we're trying to get to. So there is a few points of turn to go, but not a massive amount.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nOkay. And if I can follow up on Simon's question as well. As some carriers and vendors are pulling back from 5G. How has Verizon's thinking evolved in 5G this year? Thank you.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah. We continue to be very excited about the opportunities that 5G has. I don't think in the U.S. we've seen people pulling back from 5G at all. In fact, I think you have seen a lot of very bullish commentary. So we will be launching the residential broadband later this year. We're on track with that.\\nCertainly happy to have the assets in place to do that, whether that be - what we've done with the network over the past few years, as we have densified the network, putting more fiber out there, which really pre-positions us to deploy 5G, gaining the 28 and 39 gigahertz spectrum that puts us in a position to be ready to deploy when the equipment ready from the OEM.\\nSo we are very bullish about 5G. We think there's tremendous upside, whether that be residential broadband, whether it be mobility. Really the most exciting pieces as you get into the new use cases that don't exist on the current technologies around IoT, B2B type applications. So we are full steam ahead on our 5G deployment.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nThank you.\\nBrady Connor\\nBrad, we're ready for the next question\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\\nBrett Feldman\\nThanks for taking the question. I'm actually going to follow up on what you were just discussing. When we talk to investors about 5G and we talk about the fixed use case, I think they all understand the addressable market and it's just a matter of how effective the product is going to be.\\nBut when we talk about mobility - and, as you noted, many of these use cases don't exist yet - are you comfortable accelerating capital investment into developing a mobile 5G network without visibility on those use cases? And if not, is there going to be a point where we might see an inflection in CapEx higher where you see that forming?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nGood morning, Brett. So I don't see us having a massive acceleration in CapEx. As you heard, we reiterated our guidance for 2018. That guidance of 170 to 178 [ph] is the same range of actual spending we've had over the past four years. So what investors should have grown accustomed to seeing for Verizon is consistent total capital spend on a disciplined methodical manner. But the items within that spend evolve over time as the technologies evolve.\\nSo this year we've already started spend on 5G. The spend on those three to five initial launch city's began earlier this year, so that's ongoing. You should expect to see spend in additional cities be underway by the end of the year, so that we're in a position to launch additional geographies in 2019.\\nBut that's within our current CapEx guidance. And as we look forward, we continue to believe that we can deploy the network within the typical range. If we see an opportunity to accelerate because of the market, we're not afraid to do so, but it will be based off of the opportunity we have in the marketplace.\\n\\nBut this really comes back to the design of the network over the past few years, by identifying the 4G network we've put a lot of the infrastructure in place that we need to deploy 5G, especially using millimeter wave spectrum.\\nSo we don't see this as being a massive uptick. This is not the same thing as when we adopted 4G and went from a CDMA based 3G network to the 4G LTE network. This is a very different network rollout. And I think you will see that in the CapEx as we go forward.\\nSo look, as you mentioned the different revenue buckets. We're very comfortable that certainly the mobility bucket gives us the opportunity to deepen our relationship with our existing customer base and look to grow that base.\\nResidential broadband is an existing market that we have opportunity to grow share in. And then the new use cases at lower latency and higher throughputs and the ability to connect many, many more device is to each individual node will create significant upside as well. But this is a multi-use asset that we think will have a strong return over time.\\nBrett Feldman\\nAnd just to be clear, your comment about capital intensity during your 5G upgrade, you were referring to both the fixed and mobile components of it? That was not unique to the fixed employment?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nIt's the same deployment. I mean, we are not building a 5G network for residential broadband and a different 5G network for mobility. We are deploying a 5G network that will have multiple revenue streams off of it.\\nSo we're very excited about the ability to do that. And in addition to have a multiple revenue streams, we are using a lot of existing assets we have in the field already today.\\nBrett Feldman\\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question.\\nBrady Connor\\nBrad, let's take the next question please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nOkay, thanks. Matt, obviously a lot of changes going on in the media space. And one of your largest competitors, AT&T, is investing in traditional media assets while you guys have focused more on new media platforms. Are you seeing anything that would change your view on that approach or any value created by combining through your distribution assets with what you see in the traditional media world? And has your guys' thinking on that evolved over time? Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah. I mean, certainly it has evolved over time, but it is very consistent with what we've said earlier this year, at this point in time as we look at the ecosystem, we're very comfortable with the approach of making sure we have distribution rights to digital content.\\nAnd you saw that with the NFL deal, the NPA deal, and I would expect to see us continue to add to that portfolio of digital rights, to distribute across various Yahoo platforms, other platforms as we go forward.\\nSo look the content space is evolving rapidly. And we think the best approach for us at this point in time is to be the independent distributor of rights out there. And we're very comfortable that we will be very effective doing that. So, no major change in terms of our approach from when we spoke on the earnings call 90 days ago.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nOkay, but just a quick follow-up. But the possibility of you guys making a more profound investment in traditional media assets like networks, whether they be cable networks or broadcast networks, should we think of that is still off the table or subject to change as we see things evolve in the media landscape?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah. I would certainly say not at this time. When we look at the landscape out there, its evolving very fast. And I am not going to say never on anything, but I look at it right now in a foreseeable future, I don't see that being the right time to jump in.\\n\\nSo we are pursuing the strategy that we've discussed. We're going to continue to add content to the Oath platforms, bring some of that content across our other distribution, whether that's wireless or Fios and we think there is significant runway to that strategy and we'll continue to monitor the broader ecosystem.\\nJohn Hodulik\\nOkay. Thanks, Matt.\\nBrady Connor\\nBrad, let's take the next question please.\\nOperator\\nYour question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\\nMichael Rollins\\nHi. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could. First, just cost-cutting that the $10 billion program generated about $200 million so far. Can you discuss the pacing of cost-cutting prospects for the balance of 2018? And also it's been you know, about a year since [Technical Difficulty] unlimited. Can you discus what the current consumption of data traffic [Technical Difficulty] smartphone and how you keep [Technical Difficulty]?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nHey, Mike, you are breaking up the last part of that question. I think you are talking about unlimited and data consumption. Can you clarify the back part?\\nMichael Rollins\\nYes, if you could just talk about the consumption of smart phone users and how it's impacting network quality.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah, absolutely. So look, I will tell you we have seen significant increase in data usage. As we move to unlimited, as expected. We also saw a change in where that usage was taking place, as the busy hour of the day changed, and also the geography where that changed.\\nSo we've seen that increase level off. We are still seeing year-over-year increases, but not the same levels that we saw after we launched unlimited. And it's got back to more normal growth rates.\\nBut you asked about what we're seeing in terms of quality across the network. And I just come back to all of the own data that we use ourselves from testing our network and others out there and what we see from third parties. And our network continues to be the standard by which all others are measured. And that has continued to be the case even after we launched a 5G.\\nSo when we launched 5G we said that we had spent a good amount of time making sure that the network was ready for it. I believe the performance over the past 12 months has demonstrated the fantastic job that our network team has done, meaning, as we moved into an unlimited world and we saw data usage increase, we continued to deliver the high quality of service that people expect from us.\\nSo I expect that to fully continue. But the network is performing incredibly well and we continue to add capacity. And so we're in great shape there.\\nYour first question around cost cutting. So 200 million approximately so far this year. As we continue to move forward, will have additional savings kick in as well. Certainly the ones that require deeper amount of process change will come in later in the quarter of the program than some of the other ones.\\nBut we - you should see it more back end loaded. I think it will be reasonably even throughout '18 and then you will see some of the structural changes kick into a greater degree over the back half of the four-year program. But we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far, but we really just started and there's a long way to go.\\nMichael Rollins\\nThanks very much.\\nBrady Connor\\nBrad, let's take the next question please\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.\\nDavid Barden\\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first one, just another cadence question, Matt. I guess last quarter you gave us the heads up about the seasonal weakness in the Oath business in the first quarter. And I think relative to wireless EBITDA outperformance and wireline EBITDA kind of in line, it seems like Oath and related corporate initiatives were maybe a little bit of a weak spot. Could you paint the picture for how that relatively sizable segment now might track over the course of the rest of 2018?\\n\\nAnd I guess the second question would be related to the business market related aspects of tax reform. Have you been able to see any economic effect on your business, business as a result of tax reform, kind of those conversations changing kind of the outlook brightening? Anything related to that would be helpful. Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah. Thanks for the question, David. Good morning, So Look, I'd like to tell you, I have seen a significant change in the level of demand from our enterprise customers. But look it's really too early.\\nI think if we look at it from our own IT department, they were not immediate because we got tax reform turning around and doing significant changes in their IT spend and their telco spend. So we'll see if that picks up as the year goes on, but nothing significant in the trajectory so far in that group.\\nIn terms of the cadence through the year, I think we said on the last call that we expected Oath to be down seasonally or sequentially from 4Q to 1Q just with the seasonal change in advertising volumes, and we certainly saw that, the results came in as we expected.\\nSo really from this point forward, we should expect to see a sequential improvement from what we saw in the first quarter, really for two reasons. One, you just got the seasonality impact that builds throughout the year. And then secondly, we're getting the underlying platforms integrated between the legacy AOL, the legacy Yahoo platforms.\\nAnd so when advertisers come into our business going forward, they can come in thorough one platform rather than the multiple platforms they come through today. So as we get the rest of that integration work completed, it will make us easier to do business with them, we think that will show up in the results.\\nBut that's an ongoing exercise, and I don't think we'll really start to see that until really the back end of the year. And so as we head into '19 where the momentum should be significantly different than it is today. So hopefully that gives you a little insight there.\\nDavid Barden\\nThanks, Matt. And if I could just do one quick follow-up, maybe related to John's question on media appetite. As you knit these two businesses together, the idea was to have the third biggest scale digital media platform in the world maybe. And do you feel like you've accomplished that goal and that you're getting the benefits of that scale? Or is incremental scale something that's necessary to really get you to the next level?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah. We have the scale today. That was why the Yahoo acquisition made so much sense. It got us to around a billion monthly active users. So now the challenge for the business is to deepen the relationship with those customers.\\nLook, if we grow the number of monthly active users, that's great. I'd be very happy to do so. But the biggest opportunity for us is to deepen the relationship we have with those consumers.\\nWe do that by bringing additional compelling content such as NFL, NPA across those assets. And you saw what we did with those properties, and more to come there. And then once you use content like that to get them on the platform, you have other content there that keeps them on the platform. And when we keep them on the platform, that gives us the opportunity to increase the attractiveness to our advertising partners.\\nSo you will see us focused on increasing the engagement with the base that we have, but we have the scale that we need to be successful in that business.\\nDavid Barden\\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\\nBrady Connor\\nBrad, we're ready for the next question.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\\nCraig Moffett\\nHi. Matt, I know you talked about not a strong level of interest in media, but it was widely reported that you at least looked at it and put in a bid for the Fox asset. So I guess if I think about assets that are for sale, you are at least looking at Fox. It sounds as though there's maybe some spectrum coming from - whether Intelsat or Dish Network always out there. And then you've also talked about your balance sheet objectives.\\n\\nCan you roll all that up for us and talk about how your priorities - how you would rank your priorities across spectrum, other operating assets or balance sheet reductions? And then - and just one quick nuance in that, your Fox bid was reportedly all stock. Would that suggest that you would not be willing to add leverage for a big acquisition?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah. So, good morning, Craig. Look, I'm not going to comment on any specific M&A rumors. That's not been our policy and I'm not going to start now. But let's talk about content in M&A in general. So I have commented already this morning that we've certainly are comfortable with the approach that we have around content across the Oath platforms and other parts of our business. And we are very focused on executing against that.\\nM&A to us is tool to help execute our strategy. If M&A allows us to accelerate the execution of our strategy at a value that provides a return, is something we look at. But it has to be consistent with the strategy and it has to have value.\\nWe don't operate in a vacuum. Lowell and I have to be aware of activity and opportunities around us and we have an obligation to make sure we understand those. So we keep an eye on everything going on in the ecosystem.\\nBut when we do M&A, it's because it fits with the strategy. And if you look at the past year, the only significant transactions we did, whether Yahoo, XO and Straight Path, they very clearly accelerate our strategy, whether that be around adding the necessary scale to our media assets as we just talked about just a couple of minutes ago, or pre-positioning our networks for being continuing the excellence in 4G world and also being in a position to succeed in 5G, whether that's adding fiber through XO or adding the spectrum assets through XO and Straight Path. We put ourselves in a position where we are in a - where we can execute our strategy and compete and generate value for shareholders over the long-term.\\nSo I wouldn't necessarily want to prioritize what's the most interesting thing for us to look at. We are very comfortable executing our strategy on a mostly organic basis, if the right opportunities come up, we take a look at them. The vast majority of things we look at don't create value and therefore we pass on them because that's the responsible thing to do to create long-term value.\\nThe strength in the balance sheet is important to us. The position in the business for long-term future growth that creates value for shareholders is also very important. And I think we've balanced those things very well over the past few years, and I expect to continue to do so\\nCraig Moffett\\nThat's very clear. Thanks, Matt.\\nBrady Connor\\nBrad, we're ready for the next question.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nJennifer Fritzsch\\nGreat. Thank you. Two if I may. Just on the service revenue guidance, you achieved it excluding the new accounting recognition ahead of schedule and I guess two questions. Why the guidance still for midyear? Could you continue to see it in the second quarter?\\nAnd then secondly, is Comcast MVNO service revenue included in that line? I think some are wondering if that's why we hit it ahead of schedule. Thanks\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah. So let me answer the last one first there. I mean, yes, certainly our service revenue includes all service revenues related to connectivity to our network, whether that be our post-paid, whether that be prepaid, or MVNO. Those service revenues that we generate from operating the network.\\nBut I would not so say that any of those pieces fit them. And within the wholesale side of our business, in addition to the MSOs obviously TracFone's there by far the biggest part of that business for us to date.\\n\\nBut look, when you look at why we got there this quarter, I think it's predominately because of our post-paid business continues to do well. You see continued to add 220,000 smartphones. The network continues to perform well, churn is very low, and that is driving the service revenue trajectory.\\nAs we described last year, we continued to add connections to our account, continue to deepen the relationship with our base, and that allows us to continue to grow the post-paid component of service revenue.\\nJennifer Fritzsch\\nGreat. Thanks, Matt.\\nBrady Connor\\nBrad, we're ready for the next question.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nThank you very much. And good morning, folks. I was wondering if I could build upon Jennifer's prior question in terms of thinking about the cable operators. If we think about your guidance, what is your expectation around competition from the cable folks with regards to their wireless services?\\nAnd any sort of potential while reciprocal competition that may come from some of the incumbent players? Just trying to get your understanding of the lay of the competitive landscape over the next several quarters as some of these services ramp.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYes. So look, as these services have started, it's pretty much been as expected in terms of the volumes that we've seen. So I would expect there to be continued competition in the marketplace. I think some of the activity you saw in the first quarter is a result of that, and I think that you saw we had a disciplined approach to that activity in the quarter. And you should expect that to continue.\\nWe will be very focused on maintaining our high quality base of customers, and we will do the things that we need to in a responsible fashion to do so. But look, anytime you add the additional players to the space, that has the opportunity to increase competitiveness, but that's baked into our plans for the year.\\nIn the grand scheme of overall volumes, the amounts of activity coming from the new in MVNO's is still relatively small and we would expect it to be that way. But look, as they get traction that will bring in more traffic to our network that we can monetize as well. So we're happy with that side of the equation too.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nThanks, very much Matt. And then, if I may, a quick follow-up in thinking about your 5G strategy. You folks have laid out a case in terms of the millimeter wave solution ramping better than anticipated from a tech perspective. And clearly your multiuse fiber infrastructure is creating a foundational layer to upgrade with lower capital intensity or without the requirement for accelerated capital intensity.\\nBut how should we think about mobility? Is there a need for a coverage layer of spectrum - an additional layer of spectrum in order to launch 5G from a mobility standpoint? And given some of the options available, whether it is 3.5 or any other option available, how should we think about your strategy to deploy mobility on 5G?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah. So, thanks. We can launch 5G mobility on our existing assets. And - but as we look forward, we have over our history continue to add spectrum to our overall portfolio. If there's opportunities to do so at a reasonable price, we would certainly do so again. But we are comfortable that we can launch 5G mobility with the assets we have.\\n5G mobility will be initially very much heavily focused on urban areas. And we have the assets in place there, and we will be ready to launch that as soon the OEMs of handsets available with 5G chipsets in them.\\nAmir Rozwadowski\\nThank you very much for giving the multi-color.\\nBrady Connor\\nThanks. Brad, we're ready for the next question please.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Scott Goldman of Jefferies. Your line is open.\\n\\nScott Goldman\\nHey. Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up to that question and one earlier as well. Matt, as you look at - you've talked a lot in the past about your ability to meet capacity with the spectrum you have, as well as the incremental tools around MIMO and 256 QAM and so forth. But it looks as though we are heading for a couple years of maybe a few auctions coming out of the FCC in terms of millimeter wave, the CBRS, the C band.\\nCan you just talk about your potential level of interest in acquiring more millimeter wave on top of what you have already acquired through Straight Path and XO or perhaps those lower 3 GHz plus bands there?\\nAnd then just a follow-up on a question earlier. You talked a bit about the trajectory of Oath from a revenue perspective going forward and a bit about the scale there. Just wondering how we should think about what the margin profile of that revenue looks like both in 2018 and perhaps as you get two or three years out into that business. Thanks.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, Scott. So look, we have participated in numerous spectrum auctions over the years. And there is also been auctions that we've either chosen not to participate in or that we have participated only in certain areas, such as the AWS [indiscernible] auction.\\nWe are very comfortable with the spectrum assets that we own as we move into the 5G world. But at the right price, spectrum is interesting. But as you've seen on 4G, there are multiple ways for us to add capacity to our network. And weather that be densification, whether that be more spectrum or weather that be deploying the evolving technologies, we take advantage of all of those things, and we look to add capacity.\\nAnd overall, the service that our customers get, at the cheapest possible way, and over time that's evolved. But we will certainly take a look at any auction that comes up, and if it makes sense for us to participate, we will. And if it doesn't, then we'll - we have other avenues to continue to deploy our networks and meet the needs of our consumers.\\nOn Oath, as you talk about the margin profile there, as they add to the revenue base, we should see the margin profile of that business improve, certainly in the latter part of this year, and then as you get into '19 and '20.\\nBut the capital intensity of that business is very different from our network businesses. And so you should expect a different margin profile there, certainly lower than you see within wireless.\\nBut when you net out the lower capital intensity with the margin profile, the intent is to certainly have a compelling return on investment.\\nScott Goldman\\nGreat. Thanks, Matt.\\nBrady Connor\\nHey Brad, I think we have time for one more question.\\nOperator\\nYour last question is from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Securities. You may go ahead.\\nMike McCormack\\nHey, guys. Thanks. Matt, just maybe a couple of follow-ups here. With respect to the competitive landscape, I know obviously you want to maintain your best customers, but what's the overall philosophy on positive handset adds? How important is that you Verizon? And as you think about the next few quarters coming up, the appetite for you guys to get perhaps more promotional to get back to positive on that?\\nOn the cable wireless stuff, and maybe you can't share much, but any sort of early takeaways on the type of customers that are opting into that? And anything you can share with respect to usage patterns would be great? Thanks,\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, Mike. Look on the cable - the type of customers, I don't think we're seeing anything particular there in terms of being one type of customer or another. But I'll let the cable guys give you more color on that as they see fit.\\nThe usage that we're seeing from those customers is as expected. So you know, nothing significantly different from what we see from the rest of that base.\\n\\nYou asked about the competitive landscape, and look, so we had 220,000 positive smartphone adds. Phones overall were slightly negative, but that's not unusual for first quarter. We've seen that the past few years and I think when you see the year as a whole, you see that become positive as momentum builds through the year.\\nI see no reason to believe that this year will be any different. We will be measured and disciplined in terms of our promotional response to the marketplace. But we've been very successful at maintaining our base.\\nYou see the churn numbers again very strong four quarters in a row at 0.80 or better. So we are maintaining that base. We deepen our relationship with our base in terms of the number of connections. And then we certainly look to add new accounts. And I think we've been successful doing that.\\nWe have more accounts now than we had a year ago. And when you are increasing the number of accounts and you're increasing the connectivity with existing accounts, that's a good approach and we will continue to be focused on doing that and growing revenues and growing margins. So that nothing really changes in 2018 as we think about how we're going to approach the wireless market.\\nMike McCormack\\nMatt, I'm sorry, just a quick follow-up on that percentage of customers that are on unsubsidized versus those that are making a phone payment, that delta continues to be pretty wide. But can you just give us a sense for how much of that is bring your own device versus proactive retention versus phones that are paid off?\\nMatthew Ellis\\nYeah. Look, as you see the elongation in the ownership cycle, you're going to see that - you know, the fact we have 81% of the base on unsubsidized pricing, but only about 49% have an active loan. As people pay off the device and they keep their devices longer than just two years, I expect you know to see that delta in that number.\\nWe've seen some level of BYOD, but that has leveled off over the past couple of quarters but we expect that to continue to be part of that delta as well. But it's actually been a pretty stable relationship over the past two or three quarters as we've largely completed the transition of the base from subsidy to the device payment model.\\nMike McCormack\\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\\nBrady Connor\\nThat's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it over to Matt for some closing comments.\\nMatthew Ellis\\nThanks, Brady. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. During the first quarter we achieved solid financial and operational performance in a competitive marketplace. We started the year with strong momentum in our business and expect the trend to continue as we progress throughout the year.\\nWe remain confident in our strategy and priorities led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a discipline capital allocation model and creating value for our customers and shareholders.\\nWe are positioning the company for long-term growth and taking advantage of the full array of opportunities in the 5G era, which is now upon us as we move into the next cycle of growth in the industry. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and focused on building the best network for the future to produce long-term value.\\nThank you, for your time today.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you, for your participation and for using Verizon conference services. You may now disconnect.\", '/article/4075444-verizons-vz-ceo-presents-j-p-morgan-technology-media-telecom-brokers-conference-transcript': 'Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) J.P. Morgan Technology, Media and Telecom Brokers Conference May 22, 2017  1:30 PM ET\\nExecutives\\nLowell McAdam - Chairman and CEO\\nAnalysts\\nPhilip Cusick - J.P. Morgan\\nPhilip Cusick\\nI think we\\'re going to get started. If you can grab a seat, thank you. My name is Phil Cusick; I cover the telecom and cable space here at J.P. Morgan. I want to thank Lowell McAdam for coming and joining me. Lowell has been the CEO of Verizon since 2011, and Chairman since 2012, and been running Verizon since quite a long time.\\nLowell McAdam\\nLong time.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nSince the business came together. I thought, just to start off and sort of warm things up. As we look over how you think of the business in the near-term and long-term, how do you see the business evolving? What are your priorities to strategically position for the next five or 10 years?\\nLowell McAdam\\nOkay, thanks, Phil, and good afternoon everyone. So, we use a mission statement inside Verizon that is, delivering the promise of the digital world. I just coincidentally -- and Jamie was there as well. We were at the Microsoft conference last week, and we had a lot of presentations about what the digital world really is. And there\\'s so much hype now about autonomous cars, and healthcare, all the things you can do from robotic surgery to long-distance consultation. We look at smart cities and you think about the electrical grid and the water grid, and managing everything from parking to information for communities. And I happen to be on the GE board, and you look at Digital Twins, and you look at being able to manage aircraft and flight, and those sorts of things. So that\\'s what we think of as the digital world and IoT.\\nAll of that is driven by having a ubiquitous broadband across the country. And it reminded me of a conversation I had with Steve Jobs, back a decade ago now, when we were beginning to move from 3G to 4G, and we talked about the potential to get to 15 megabits delivered to the handset. And Steve\\'s comment to me was, \"You had me at 10,\" but he could see what you could do if you had 10 megabits to a smart phone. Well, now we\\'re talking about 100 times that, a gigabit to the smart phone. You\\'re looking at fiber into enterprises and small businesses that will deliver a terabit of service. So our role and where I see our company evolving is providing more and more high-speed ubiquitous wireless and fiber-based services to customers. So that\\'s why, I\\'m sure we\\'ll get into it, but that\\'s why we did the deal with Corning that we did for 12.5 million fiber miles a year for the next three years. And we added on, with Prysmian, right after that deal.\\nThat\\'s why we\\'re pushing as hard as we are on 5G because we see the opportunity that if you can really deliver a gigabit and up to mobile device or in fixed mobile, fixed wireless, you can see the potential in the marketplace. And you see the excitement coming out of the Valley. So, I won\\'t be around to see all of this for sure, but the potential for the change in peoples\\' lives because of telecom services I think is going to be more dramatic, as we make this next leap, than it\\'s been ever before in the history of the business. \\nPhilip Cusick\\nI wont ask you about your plans for your legacy, given what Jimmy said. But let me follow-up there. Because I think a lot of us think more in terms of weeks, or quarters, or a year maybe. And I don\\'t think I understand what the potential is for IoT relative to the size of the profit pool today. So if you look five years or 10 years down the road, what are the things that are really driving profit for Verizon that you\\'re getting ready for?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, there\\'s two layers. First, on the connectivity side, you can make a very good return. That\\'s why we\\'re deploying the kind of fiber we\\'re deploying across the country. And if you see the OEMs, the manufacturers, and the consumers\\' eyes light up over what you could do with a gigabit to the handset you see huge potential there. But we\\'ve also decided to go beyond the connectivity layers you know, Phil, and get into things about delivering some of these applications to market. So we\\'ve invested a lot in sensors, and platforms to deliver Smart City applications, we\\'ve invested in telematics through Telogis and Fleetmatics, along with the Hughes platform that we had already, because we see the intelligent transportation systems moving into intelligent supply chain systems as well.\\n\\nAnd then if you look at the AOL and Yahoo opportunity, people always want to know what we\\'re going to buy next, we haven\\'t even closed on Yahoo, so give us a few minutes here. But you see the potential of 1.3 billion users on a platform like AOL and Yahoo, and you see the advertising potential and the content potential, there are some huge profit pools out there.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nAnd I still come back to the same question, which is the quantifying that opportunity for investors, and looking five or 10 years out as the mobile business changes. And I\\'m sure it won\\'t be recognizable then. But the size that Verizon could be at that point, and what people are really going to be excited about over that timeframe.\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, there\\'s a lot of different reports probably by people in the room here about how big Smart Cities can be. They\\'re talking about trillions of dollars of impact to GDP. If you take it down, the Cisco report is a very good report, I think, that gets more into parts of the geographies of the world and the impact on the economy, and the impact on the bottom lines. But every one of these areas we\\'re talking about can have revenue potentials of $20 billion when you start even to shave it down into just the U.S. and multiple carriers, and those sorts of things. So, look, I\\'m not going to sit here, I\\'m not that clairvoyant. I can\\'t tell you 10 years from now what at top line revenue is going to look like for Verizon. But what the point for me is that we have the assets and are positioning ourselves to be in a leadership position when it comes to 5G and to fiber.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nOkay. So let\\'s follow-up with fiber, your -- Boston\\'s a good example of the new way of deploying fiber, right?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nCan you talk about what you\\'re doing there versus the older Fios builds?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, well if you think about Fios, it was a very purpose-built set of fibers. It went into the neighborhood, we delivered the fiber, two to each resident, and you aggregate it up to maybe 144 fibers in a cable by the time you got back to the central office. We had parallel networks for wholesale. So if were selling dark fiber to AT&T for a cell tower, or Verizon Wireless was buying their fiber it was much more point-to-point because that\\'s where the cell towers were. The architecture that we\\'re building in Boston, and now in other cities around, is a multi-use, where we\\'ll go in and -- it turns out building to the fiber requirements for wireless and a 4G with a dense small-cell deployment is actually the best architecture for everything because you\\'re going to run right by the enterprise, you\\'re going to run right by the small business.\\nIn many cases, you\\'re out in the neighborhoods. And it sets you up for delivering things like smart cities. And when you deliver smart cities you\\'re starting to put fiber to every light post. And then every light post becomes a potential small cell for 5G. So this multi-use architecture is far more cost effective than the old purpose-built fibers. And if you look at the manufacturing capabilities of a company like Corning, literally from our perspective being the constructor of the network, the number of fibers that you put in the cable are a matter of pennies per foot. So you\\'re far better off today doing what we\\'re doing in Boston, and that\\'s putting 1,700 strand cables in the main feeder route so that you can serve these networks as we go forward.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nAnd I think when you first referenced 1,700 strands a few weeks ago, even some of your partners and some of your shared infrastructure partners were a bit shocked. This is the main feeder cables for the network. How do you think about the timeframe to use those, is that like a 100-year build let\\'s just get this done, or you think that\\'s necessary in the next dozen years or so?\\n\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, if you think about a city like Boston, and you think about what Mayor Walsh wants to do in this town with providing broadband to seniors, making sure every school has the fastest broadband available so that they have access to the leading edge educational tools. If you look at what businesses, like GE, who just relocated to Boston, the kind of bandwidth they require, and the financial institutions the kind of bandwidth they require, certainly not a 100-year build. And the fact that some people are going, \"Oh my gosh, we\\'re shocked at that,\" I think shows you that they don\\'t -- haven\\'t yet understood the kind of leap that we\\'re going to make with 5G. Because if you think about it, you\\'re going to deliver a gigabit of throughput to every home out there, you\\'re going to need this sort of fiber capacity. And I think it\\'s a decade kind of build or a two-decade kind of build. It\\'s certainly not much longer than that, because this is going to be one of those, if you build it there\\'ll come moments. And we\\'ve seen that every time we\\'ve increased speed and capacity in our networks, it\\'s been filled up very quickly with new applications.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nAnd given all that demand you see coming down the pipe, and the sort of leap of, in order of magnitude, of depth that you want to build. Is that the driver for doing a lot more of this yourself it seems like, than you were a couple of years ago, where you were outsourcing more of it.\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, I think a couple of years ago I would use -- we had a point-to-point mentality, which is the mentality you see throughout the industry at this point. So if an enterprise wants to tie two offices together, you literally go to one of the fiber companies or to one of the telecos, and you say, give me a strand between here and there. If you\\'re expecting a 4G densified network or a 5G high-capacity network you really need to come in and build much more of a grid approach. It\\'s much more like the cardiovascular system if you look at it than it is point-to-point. And that\\'s the major change that we\\'re seeing.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nThat capillary network that you\\'ve talked about?\\nLowell McAdam\\nRight.\\nLowell McAdam\\nAnd you mentioned a few weeks ago 100,000 small cells, I think it was on Manhattan. Is that literally the every light post vision, is that where we get?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, and I think you have to look at the capacity requirements in each city. And we, at our cell site event that you referred to a couple of weeks ago, we showed a video. And I think it\\'s still up on our Web site, worth everyone, if you\\'re interested in that topic, to go look at that video. But Chicago is very different and San Francisco is very different than New York. So, if you think about when you\\'re out into the neighborhoods and you want to provide a 5G over-the-top broadband and video, you\\'re probably on every light post, in a city probably not as much, you\\'re going to have as many fibers going directly into the enterprises to give them that capacity. So, it really varies. So, 100,000 is an interesting number for one particular city. I\\'m not sure it\\'s the rule of thumb for every city out there. It depends on their needs.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nRight. And once you have a small cell, whether it\\'s that level of density or something a little less dramatic, what are the new applications you can start to provide?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes. I mean all the different -- you get a big City Mayor up here, I happen to be talking to Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, his big issues are education, and then obviously he\\'s got a lot of crime issues. So you can put the shock detection sensors up there. You can put cameras on every street corner, if that\\'s what you want; you can do traffic management, which in Boston is one of Mayor Walsh\\'s biggest, biggest issues that he\\'s dealing with. So I think the -- what we\\'re trying to do, Phil, is position ourselves to provide that sort of platform and then some specific applications around things like Telematics, and we bought a company called LQD WiFi, which does all of the information kiosks that you can put up in every city. And we\\'ve got sensor technologies for everything from motion detection, there\\'s some new gas sensing detectors coming out now for pollution and managing of toxic issues in a city. So there is going to be all sorts of opportunities like that.\\n\\nPhilip Cusick\\nAnd it seems like a tremendous build over a long period of time, is it something that can be done for Verizon\\'s legacy CapEx envelope?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, I think we haven\\'t guided for out years at this point, but as I look out over the next 12 years, I think we\\'re in that same general envelope, because there\\'s one thing that we\\'ve done recently is we\\'ve consolidated all of our network assets under one leader, and we hired Hans Vestberg to come in, who was the Former CEO of Ericsson. And he\\'s had the opportunity to look at networks all over the world. And one of the ones that fascinate me is India. You see how well they do with so little, such little amount of spectrum. So, we do expect that we as we combine those assets together, we can see our costs drop dramatically in supporting the current network, and we can redirect some of those funds into this sort of a build.\\nAnd I think a lot of what will drive that, Phil, is as we go through the Boston build, and we\\'ve got think 11 other cities that we\\'re building now, and we\\'ve got the 5G trials out in the marketplace over the summer, we\\'ll be able to get a much better sense of market adoption and how hard we should push on this. But we view what we signed up for is a three to five year build with Corning right now, and then we\\'ll decide as we augmented based on market requirements.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nOkay. And following up on 5G, you\\'ve talked about sort of the fixed replacement type of offer as one of the first 5G applications, how excited are you about that after almost two years of talking about it in public, how your thoughts changed?\\nLowell McAdam\\nI would say if anything we\\'re more excited about it, so, if you think about the Verizon footprint, we\\'ve got the Fios build between Washington and Boston now. And so, there\\'s a huge part of the U.S. that we don\\'t provide those services to, and we knew going in and doing a Fios like build didn\\'t make any sense economically. And when you look at the spectrum and the cost of small cells versus the cost of spectrum in the old AWS auction sort of environment, it was clear to us that building the fiber infrastructure to densify via small cells was better than the alternative of a buying spectrum.\\nWell, when you looked at the architecture that you have when you do that and you see the little bit you\\'d have to do it incrementally to be ready for 5G, then you see, okay, we could be a significant player for delivering broadband and video over-the-top, over that exact same network, and it\\'s almost I mean incrementally and the cost is miniscule to be able to address a very large market outside of the Washington and the Boston corridors.\\nSo, as we have built that architecture, 5G on a fixed broadband perspective was the best application for us. We did not need to wait for all of the mobile standards, we didn\\'t have to wait for it to be into a -- crammed into an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy device. You can use basically your home router that you have today, just put some different chips in it, and we\\'re working with Intel on that, and you are then a broadband provider and a TV provider outside of your franchise footprint.\\nSo, the biggest question for us was what was the spectrum availability, and then what\\'s the propagation characteristics of that spectrum? While the FCC declared 28 and 39 to be sort of the standards, which is what you see in Korea and Japan and other places, and through purchasing the XO fiber assets, which we wanted to build out our fiber platform, we also got a very substantial, I guess, 40% of the 28 gig spectrum out there, and at a very reasonable price. So we think we\\'ve got all of the assets, so that part was good. Then the next thing is what\\'s the propagation look like? We were expecting, let\\'s say, less than 1,000 feet of propagation to deliver a gig, and the experiments we\\'re seeing in the field and that I saw when I was in Korea about a month ago working with our partners in Korea on that, we\\'re seeing substantially more than that 1,000 foot propagation. So, we\\'re feeling very bullish on it at this point, and we\\'ll be able to say more about that after we go through the trials over the summer.\\n\\nPhilip Cusick\\nI think a lot of people are skeptical of the practical aspects of the distance, and we people talk about foliage and trucks block in the way, is that a concern, do you think that\\'s overblown?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, I think Phil, the thing that I see in our industry, and I guard against this within Verizon is you tend to lock-in on the design principles from the 2000s, because that\\'s when the market was -- that\\'s when wireless was sort of exploding. And back then, you didn\\'t have MIMO, you know, Massive In, Massive Out antenna structures, you didn\\'t have the computing power that you had to do signal processing that you can do today. So, we tend to lock-in that, \"Oh my God, you\\'ve got to have more AWS spectrum.\" Well, no, you don\\'t. Small cells are a fraction of what they were and cost-wise even five years ago. So, with the antenna system, I\\'ll give you an example, we were at 2000 feet from the receiver in Samsung\\'s Technology Park, we were delivering 1.8 gigs. We said, \"Okay, take that truck, drive it around the backside of the building,\" so there is no possible way you will have a direct line of sight, 2000 feet away, it delivered 1.4 gigabytes of throughput. And the reason was that it took all the different reflections and the computers were able to process and then get that signal back up.\\nSo, in the field today we\\'re doing have the heavy foliage. We\\'re doing downtown urban areas. We\\'re doing residential. We\\'re doing long haul where there\\'s -- you know, you\\'re out in a rural area and you don\\'t have anything for five miles before you get through to the next house, and we\\'re going to shake all of that out, but I think people when they say, \"Oh, it\\'s just line of sight,\" they\\'ve forgotten the computer technology that you see in the antenna systems today that you didn\\'t have even five years ago.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nI think that will be fun. And as the economics of that build interesting enough to go into a too aggressive broadband player market where you\\'re not today, or do you think it\\'s a little bit less attractive?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, we\\'ll find out. I mean, I think as you do the -- as you do the trials, the thing that I\\'m trying to push the envelope on, Phil, is that I came from a very small town and I know what rural markets today don\\'t get broadband service. So, this is a no-brainer in urban and suburban markets. The question is can you go out to that town of 500 people and offer at least in the community area out there, because that if you look at it just from a business perspective, there\\'s -- you know it\\'s very price inelastic, because they\\'re -- you know they really want that sort of service. But if you think about Jamie\\'s comment about good economic policies and providing the growth engine for the country, you know, five and 10 years from now, I think broadband is the thing that is going to provide the economic engine, and the farther we can push that out into the various geographies, that\\'s kind of what excites me right now.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nOkay. And as you think about ancillary services to put on top of that, you\\'ve done a lot in video over the last year. You bought the rights to stream, I think it\\'s the London NFL game the next one. One of your executives has talked about pre-positioning content assets over time. I mean, is there a pre-positioning for some type of OTT offer. Do you think you could differentiate there?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, well that all goes to the AOL Yahoo strategy. So Tim has talked a lot about having four pillars. Sometimes he gets excited and says five, but it\\'s news, sports, finance, entertainment, lifestyle. If you think about pre-positioning for content and you do things like a sports program you can very easily take that across to background content on lifestyle of Tom Brady or whatever, and you can go into the finance side, you can go across all four or five of those pillars with certain kinds of content. So our plan, first we have to close Yahoo. We hope to do that around the middle of June. Then we have to get it integrated. And Tim and the team have done a very good job. We\\'ve got good representation from Yahoo management as well as AOL management. And then get these pillars in place, get the platforms in place and start to build the content.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve done some interesting thing with Hearst. So far we\\'ve gone in and bought a couple of properties with them. And we\\'re learning a lot there, and the NFL game is going to be another way to learn about that. We\\'ve done a lot with the Woman\\'s Soccer League this summer, and it\\'s getting a lot of viewership. So the platform will be in place to do an over-the-top sort of play. And we\\'ll go out and test it. But we have not committed to a launch date or anything. We\\'re going to see how this evolves.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nAnd you\\'ve spent, with Yahoo, about $10 billion putting together that asset base for Tim to work with. Do you have the assets in place that you need the substantial ones anyway?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, for a while, yes. I mean, I think about this as a Verizon Wireless sort of moment. I say that to Marni Walden who leads that for both Telematics and for the AOL-Yahoo, the Oath brand. When we put together Verizon Wireless we had four big pieces that we put together, but we didn\\'t stop. We kept adding smaller companies to fill out the footprint. And I think that\\'s what\\'s going to happen. So people that want to speculate -- I\\'ll say this about M&A, I think there\\'s a lot more, let\\'s call it, energy in Wall Street in a media over these big M&A deals than there is in most businesses at this point. And I know you\\'ve had a few here that are talking about some high profiles. But Verizon has been very consistent over the history of Verizon, 18 years now, as we have an asset, we learn about the asset. We put a few other pieces together. We build on that asset. And then we fill in as we go. So you\\'re never really done. But we\\'ve got the big thing to chew on here with Yahoo. We\\'ve got to get those platforms in place. And a few years out, who knows. But I think in the short run we\\'re just talking about opportunities to sort of fill in through some smaller content pieces.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nSo let me -- I\\'m skipping around a little bit, but I wanted to ask you this. There was an article in the paper a few weeks ago about Verizon has to do something. And we can talk bout 4G wireless in a few minutes. But as you just described, the company hasn\\'t been one for transformative M&A.\\nLowell McAdam\\nRight.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nI think there\\'s a desire for someone to do something when things aren\\'t happening immediately. How do you think about the need for Verizon to do something or you just sort of stick with your knitting going forward.\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, the folks that write -- Jamie and I were talking beforehand, the older we get the less politically correct we are. And the people that write articles like that haven\\'t run big businesses before. So you start feeling pressure and do knee-jerks like that you end up with Sprint Nextel or AOL-Time Warner or some of those things that have been pretty difficult to manage. So, look, we have always been a company that prefers to go organic growth. But if there was an opportunity to accelerate the strategy we would look at that. And people should be fired if they don\\'t look at those sorts of things. But Ivan, when he and Larry Babbio, and Dennis Strigl put together the big deal on Verizon to create Wireless, they had already decided that between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, Wireless was a place they wanted to play. So this was a way for them to accelerate. And I think that culture still exists within the business, because when you do these quote \"Transformative M&As\" you\\'ve got an awful lot of cultural issues and integration issues you have to deal with.\\nSo, I don\\'t want anybody to think we write those off as a possibility. But I think we\\'ve shown by doing the deal with Corning, following up with Prysmian, now at least this point we\\'re the high bidder. It\\'s got to be approved, but straight path. We\\'ve shown that we\\'re pretty committed to 5G, and we\\'re very committed to fiber. And we\\'ve got AOL and Yahoo. This is a strong position there, and we\\'re going to continue to build on that.\\n\\nPhilip Cusick\\nSo, I think I understand really well the long-term vision, even like the three to five, 10-year vision of Verizon. I think the challenge that a lot of investors in the room have is what happens between now and when 5G really starts to build some momentum. So how do you think about the competitive landscape in wireless today, and what can you do?\\nLowell McAdam\\nWell, look, I don\\'t think that the -- and I may be one of the few that still says that the wireless industry has been competitive from day one. I mean, we went through a period when we were first to 4G, which we\\'re doing our best to replicate now with 5G, where no one was ready to follow us. They didn\\'t want to make the investment. And so we had 18 to 24 months where we were the ones that were innovating on the platform. And we think that\\'ll be the case on 5G. In the short-term, customers have clearly indicated that the simplicity of unlimited is very attractive to them. I\\'d also point out though that the benefits of the best network is still incredibly relevant to customers, because you see that -- and we\\'ve always said this, Phil, you\\'ve heard me say this a hundred times, as long as we\\'re within 25% of the low-cost provider we\\'re going to take our fair share of the market.\\nAnd if you look at fourth quarter last year, we were having to do an awful lot to defend, what I\\'ll call, the non-unlimited ground that we had. And we still had below 0.9 for seven quarters or whatever it was of customer loyalty. But the feedback we were getting from customers was, \"Look, the simplicity here is such that we feel like we really need unlimited.\" So we made sure that the network was strong, and we could do what we needed to do, and made that move in the middle of February. And we\\'ve been extremely pleased with the results. Now, for investors, they take a look, okay, we had EIP a year-and-a-half ago, the equipment installment plan. So that put pressure on top line revenue. In the short run, unlimited puts pressure on top line revenue. But we, again, at our Cell Site event, so there\\'s a video on this, the charts at least are out there. We showed how that will continue and -- that pressure will continue in second quarter. But in the third and fourth quarter it begins to mitigate and we start to see improvement in that pressure on revenue.\\nSo we think that unlimited and the best quality network still gives us the ability to innovate. Unlimited is not the end state, it\\'s a step along the way. And we think there\\'s plenty of opportunity for us to innovate between AOL, Yahoo, and the main core of the business until 5G comes online.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nAnd have you seen the beginning of that, the sort of uplift in consumer spending to get to unlimited from where they had been lower?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, so there\\'s a couple of competing interests here. So the first people that move are the ones that did a lot of overage, so you do see compression of their revenue. But then, what we\\'re seeing now is the people that just want to have the safety and security of knowing they aren\\'t going to have overages, so they\\'re actually going up in price. So those two are sort of offsetting each other, and that\\'s why you see the migration down through first and second quarter, but then it starts to lessen, and actually begins to turn the other direction in third and fourth quarter.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nOkay. So again, going back to -- for the investors there who are here, who are watching service revenue decline, what\\'s the message you sort of leave them with as they think about why they should own Verizon in the next one-two years as we watch that transition happen?\\nLowell McAdam\\nYes, so I think that what I said publicly in the Cell Site a few weeks ago was first quarter is not what you have come to expect out of Verizon, and it\\'s not what you should expect out of Verizon going forward. So without telegraphing a bunch of things to our competition, we see, let\\'s just say, different products and different structures that\\'ll be rolling out even the second half of this year, and then on into \\'18, which will return us to the position that we like to be in, which is strong growth and strong profitability.\\n\\nPhilip Cusick\\nGood. That\\'s a great full stop.\\nLowell McAdam\\nOkay.\\nPhilip Cusick\\nThank you very much.\\nLowell McAdam\\nThank you all.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nEnd of Q&A'}\n"
